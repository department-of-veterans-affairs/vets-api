EDUCATION BENEFIT BEING APPLIED FOR: Chapter 33 - Effective: 8/22/2016

By electing Chapter 33, I acknowledge that I understand the following:
* I may not receive more than a total of 48 months of benefits under two or more programs.
* If electing chapter 33 in lieu of chapter 30, my months of entitlement under chapter 33 will be limited to the number of months of entitlement remaining under chapter 30 on the effective date of my election.
* I will not receive a Montgomery GI Bill (Active Duty-Chapter 30 or Selected reserve-Chapter 1606) 'Kicker' under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, unless I was eligible for the kicker at the time I applied and I relinquished that benefit for the Post-9/11 GI Bill-Chapter 33.
* When choosing the effective date, I understand that benefits for training under Chapter 33 are not payable prior to that date.
