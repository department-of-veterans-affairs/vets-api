# This script was written to help us validate what appears in the web appointments indexes
# vs the mobile appointments index. It compares the appointment ids in the web html against
# the appointments received from the mobile appointments index. It then formats the results
# to highlight which ids aren't present in both sources.

# This script is only being used for validating v2 appointments work and will probably not be of
# any value for long. Delete it once we're confident that v2 appointments are working correctly.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
# 1) in the web app, use the inspector to copy the html. Do not attempt to save the html by saving
# the web page. That approach omitted the important parts. Paste the html into files with a
# .txt extension in a directory that contains no other txt files.
# 2) fetch an access token for the test user
# 3) in terminal, run:
# bundle exec ruby modules/mobile/lib/scripts/appointments_list_validation.rb path/to/dir/with/txt/files access_token

# WARNING: for some reason the useCache param does not work. You may have to break the cache via postman instead.
