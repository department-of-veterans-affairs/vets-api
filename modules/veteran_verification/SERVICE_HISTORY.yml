    Veteran Verification - Service History

    ## Background

    The use-case of this API is to allow third-parties
    to access the service history of a Veteran after receiving authorization to
    do so using an Open ID Connect flow.

    The Service History API passes requests through to eMIS, the Enterprise
    Military Information Service, and formats the response into consumable data.

    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized using a Bearer token issued through an OpenID
    Connect service to allow third-party applications. The token should be
    submitted as an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>`.

    ### Service History Request

    Allows a third-party application to request service history with the authorization
    of a Veteran.

    1. Client Request: GET https://dev-api.va.gov/services/veteran_verification/v0/service_history
       * Provide the Bearer token as a header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the Veteran's complete service history
