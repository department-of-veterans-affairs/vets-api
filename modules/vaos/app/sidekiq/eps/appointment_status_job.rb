  ##
  # Sidekiq job responsible for checking appointment processing status and handling retries.
  #
  # This job monitors submitted appointments to ensure they complete successfully.
  # It periodically checks the appointment status and retries up to MAX_RETRIES times
  # if the appointment is still in a pending state. If maximum retries are reached
  # or an error occurs, it triggers an email notification to the user via the
  # AppointmentStatusEmailJob.
  #
  # The job implements a polling mechanism with exponential backoff to check
  # appointment completion status from the EPS (Enterprise Person Service).
  #
  # @example Enqueue the job
  #   Eps::AppointmentStatusJob.perform_async(user_uuid, appointment_id_last4)
  #
  # @example Enqueue with custom retry count
  #   Eps::AppointmentStatusJob.perform_async(user_uuid, appointment_id_last4, 1)
