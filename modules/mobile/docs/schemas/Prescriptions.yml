          Count of different types of prescriptions. "active" contains prescriptions that have a `refillStatus` of active,
          submitted, providerHold, activeParked, refillinprocess, and/or prescriptions that have a tracking number 
          associated with them. If a prescriptions does not meet the criteria for "active", it appends it's `refillStatus` to the list. 
          If a refillStatus is not present in any prescription, it will not be included in this list.
          See `refillStatus` enum for all possible values. "isRefillable" is a separate count of prescriptions with `isRefillable` set to true. 
          A prescription can be counted in both `isRefillable` and any other status count.
        example:
            active: 1
            isRefillable: 1
            discontinued: 1
            expired: 2
            historical: 3
            pending: 1
            transferred: 2
            submitted: 1
            hold: 1
            unknown: 2
            total: 14

        description: |
          Notifies if user has any prescriptions that are Non-VA (NV). This boolean will be set regardless of
          the set of data returned in the "data" section of the response (ie. this will still be set to "true"
          if the user has Non-VA meds but the current page of the response does not show any).
