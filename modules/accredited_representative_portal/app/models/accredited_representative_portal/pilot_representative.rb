module AccreditedRepresentativePortal
  # Represents a pilot representative within the Accredited Representative Portal.
  # This class is responsible for managing the data associated with individuals who have
  # been verified as representatives by the ARF Team. The model includes validations to ensure the presence and
  # uniqueness of identifiers such as the OGC registration number and email.
  #
  # Currently, this model is populated manually by engineers as users are accepted into the pilot program.
  # There is potential for a UI to be developed in the future that would facilitate administrative tasks
  # related to managing pilot representatives.
  #
  # A more automated process may be possible once OGC and MPI data facilitate such a process.
  #
  # == Associations
  # This model may eventually be associated with AccreditedIndividuals to pull POA codes,
  # if they exist, based on the OGC registration number. It currently does so via a helper method.
