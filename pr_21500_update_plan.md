# PR #21500 Update Plan

## Summary
This document outlines the steps to address comments and suggested changes for PR #21500: "Add Form0781StateSnapshotJob for tracking 0781 form metrics"

## Files to Update

1. **app/sidekiq/form0781_state_snapshot_job.rb** - Main job implementation
2. **spec/sidekiq/form0781_state_snapshot_job_spec.rb** - Test file for the job

## PR Comments to Address

1. **Date Filtering for Old Form Metrics**
   > "as of ToT 4/2/2025: decision is to put a start date here as it is meant to capture the metrics for rollout"
   
   This suggests we need to add a start date filter to the old 0781 submissions query, likely to only count submissions after the rollout date (4/2/2025).
   
   > "needs to support a start date so we don't query backwards unecessarily"
   
   > "needs to support dates; can place it forward a year in case old ones are mistaknigly still submitted"
   
   > "should we do start date forward submissions to compare to the old form version?"

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   > "should we pluck instead of map for these? test removing .sort"
   
   Consider using pluck instead of map for better performance and whether sorting is necessary.
   
   > "also memoize Form526Submission query result"
   
   Memoize Form526Submission query results to avoid redundant database queries.

3. **Object Structure**
   > "have the key in the object map the method name - prefix the key with the same prefix as the value"
   
   Review the object structure for consistency in naming conventions.

## Current Status

1. **Date Filtering**: Already implemented in the local version for old 0781 form methods, specifically:
   - `old_0781_submissions`
   - `old_0781_successful_submissions`
   - `old_0781_failed_submissions`
   
   Each method now includes the filter: `.where('created_at >= ?', rollout_date)` with `rollout_date = Date.new(2025, 4, 2)`

## Remaining Changes

1. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Replace `map(&:id).sort` with `pluck(:id)` where appropriate
   - Consider removing `.sort` if ordering is not critical
   - Memoize Form526Submission query results

2. **Method Naming Consistency**:
   - Review object structure in `load_snapshot_state` method
   - Ensure consistency between method names and the keys used in the returned hash

3. **Update Tests**:
   - Ensure tests properly validate the date filtering
   - Update mock data to reflect these changes

## Implementation Steps

1. âœ… Add date filtering to old 0781 submission methods (COMPLETED)
2. Optimize queries by replacing map with pluck and removing unnecessary sorts
3. Memoize Form526Submission query result to avoid redundant database calls
4. Review and update method naming consistency
5. Update tests to account for all changes
6. Run tests to ensure everything passes
