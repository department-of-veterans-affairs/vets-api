  This endpoint accepts the `filter` param. This must be provided in the format `filter[model_attribute][operation]=value`. For example, if your model implements an attribute called "status" and you want to receive only records where the status equals "complete", you would add the param `filter[status][eq]=complete`. At this time the only operations supported are eq and not_eq.
