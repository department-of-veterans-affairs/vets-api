    ## The API for managing Veterans Affairs Online Scheduling

    These endpoints give hooks into VAOS, an existing product suite, containing a veteran-facing healthcare appointment online scheduling tool of
    the same name (formerly named VAR - Veteran Appointment Request), a scheduler-facing appointment management tool named Schedule Manager, and a schedule configuration utility for VA facilities, named VATS (VA Tool Set).
