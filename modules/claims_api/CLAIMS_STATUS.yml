  title: Benefits Claims
  description: |
    Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) claims submission and status checking.
     ## Background
     Use this API to submit a Veteran's benefits claim, and to request the status of a Veteran's benefits claim.
     The Benefit Claim API passes data through to Electronic Veterans Self Service, EVSS. EVSS uses VAAFI to authenticate requests. Consumers of this API not using OAuth will need to pass the minimum VAAFI headers to this service to retrieve records.
     ## Design
     ### Authorization
     API requests are authorized by means of a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header
    with name "apikey".
     ### List Claims Request
     Allows a client to check claims object from EVSS.
     1. Client Request: GET https://dev-api.va.gov/services/claims/v0/claims
        * Provide the Veteran's SSN as the X-VA-SSN header
        * Provide the VA username of the organization or person requesting the claim object as the X-VA-User header
        * Provide the Veteran's First Name as X-VA-First-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Last Name as X-VA-Last-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Birth Date as X-VA-Birth-Date in the iso8601 format
        * Provide the Veteran's EDIPI as X-VA-EDIPI
     2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the current object of claims
     ### Single claim request
     Allows a client to retrieve claim object by EVSS id.
     1. Client Request: GET https://dev-api.va.gov/services/claims/v0/claims/123123
        * Provide the Veteran's SSN as the X-VA-SSN header
        * Provide the VA username of the organization or person requesting the claim object as the X-VA-User header
        * Provide the Veteran's First Name as X-VA-First-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Last Name as X-VA-Last-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Birth Date as X-VA-Birth-Date in the iso8601 format
        * Provide the Veteran's EDIPI as X-VA-EDIPI
     2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the current object of the requested claim
     ### Single 526 claim form submission
     Allows a client to post 526 claim form by EVSS id.
     1. Client Request: POST https://dev-api.va.gov/services/claims/v0/form/526
        * Provide the Veteran's SSN as the X-VA-SSN header
        * Provide the VA username of the organization or person submitting the form as the X-VA-User header
        * Provide the Veteran's First Name as X-VA-First-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Last Name as X-VA-Last-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Birth Date as X-VA-Birth-Date in the iso8601 format
        * Provide the Veteran's EDIPI as X-VA-EDIPI
        * Provide the Veteran's Gender as X-VA-Gender
     2. Service Response: A JSON API object with a token for checking the requested claim status
     ### Upload 526 Claim Attachments
     Allows a client to post 526 claim form by EVSS id.
     1. Client Request: POST https://dev-api.va.gov/services/claims/v0/form/526/{id}/attachments
        * Provide the Veteran's SSN as the X-VA-SSN header
        * Provide the VA username of the organization or person submitting the form as the X-VA-User header
        * Provide the Veteran's First Name as X-VA-First-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Last Name as X-VA-Last-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Birth Date as X-VA-Birth-Date in the iso8601 format

     #### 526 Staging Mock Override

      Given the downstream connections of this API, we allow (**IN DEVELOPER ENVIRONMENT ONLY**) passing in a header `Status-Override` on the `/uploads/{id}` endpoint that will allow you to change the status of your submission to simulate the various scenarios. The available statuses are `pending`, `uploaded`, `recieved`, `processing`, `success`, `error`.
      Given the downstream connections of this API, we allow (**IN STAGING ENVIRONMENT ONLY**) passing in a header `Mock-Override` on the request to the 526 creation endpoint. This will allow you to bypass the usage of mocks and actually push the request downstream.
