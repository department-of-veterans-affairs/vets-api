# `vets-api` operates as an API for our frontend, `vets-website`
# Since our frontend content is not rendered by the server, Rails' `protect_from_forgery` will not work.
# Still, our frontend provides form submissions for our end users.  Many of these forms do not require authentication
# CSRF proctection is still needed.  This module provides that protection following the same basic pattern
# that is used by Rails' `protect_from_forgery`
# Whereas `protect_from_forgery` uses `session` and hidden form fields, we are using `cookies` and request headers.
