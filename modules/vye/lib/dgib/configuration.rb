        # one of the issues we ran into was with self signed certificates being in the keychain. VA signs it's
        # own certificates, so we need to inlude the ones used.
        # this command identified the ones we needed to include:
        # openssl s_client -connect dgi-afs003-vaapi.np.afsp.io:443 -showcerts
        # You have to scroll through the output and find the ones it complains about.
        # There were two of them and in order for this to work right, they neeeded to be concatenated into one file.
        # cat VA-Internal-S2-ICA11.crt VA-Internal-S2-RCA2.crt > VA-Internal-S2-ICA11-RCA2-combined-cert.pem
        # It was necesary to check the file and carriage return it because it didn't line break properly at the
        # end of the first certificate and the start of the second.
        # Not sure if the order of the concatenation matters here.

        # Platform has a link for where the individual certs can be downloaded here
        # http://aia.pki.va.gov/PKI/AIA/VA/
        # And a script here that can be used to download and install all of them.

        # The script needs tweaking for Ubuntu.
        # Remove line 40(ish) as it's for RHEL and will cause the script to crash.

        # line 43(ish) should be changed from this: update-ca-trust to this: update-ca-certificates
