    Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) document uploads.
    
    ## Background
    
    This API is being provided as a proof of concept of a general-purpose VA 
    API gateway. The use case is to allow authorized third-party developers to 
    submit VBA documents and have a high degree of assurance that those documents 
    will be processed and stored in the appropriate VA data system.
    
    The Document Upload API passes data through to ICMHS aka “Central Mail API”.
    Central Mail API accepts a payload consisting of a document in PDF format, zero or more
    optional attachments in PDF format, and some JSON metadata. The metadata describes the
    document, attachments, and identifies the person that the document relates to. This payload is
    encoded as multipart/form-data. A unique identifier supplied with the payload can be used to
    subsequently request the processing status of the uploaded document package.
    
    ## Design
    
    ### Authorization
    
    API requests are authorized by means of a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header
    with name "apikey".

    ### Upload Operation
    
    Allows a client to upload a document package (form + attachments + metadata).

    1. Client Request: POST https://api.vets.gov/services/vba_documents/v0/
        * No request body or parameters required
    
    2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the following attributes:
        * `guid`: An identifier that can be used for subsequent status requests
        * `location`: A URL to which the actual document package payload can be submitted
          in the next step. The URL is specific to this upload request and should not be
          re-used for subsequent uploads. The URL is valid for 900 seconds (15 minutes)
          from the time of this response.
          
    3. Client Request: PUT to the location URL returned in Step 2.
        * Request body should be encoded as multipart/form-data, equivalent to that
          generated by an HTML form submission or using “curl -F…”. The format is
          described in more detail below.
        * No `apikey` authorization header is required for this request, as authorization is
          embedded in the signed location URL.
          
    4. Service Response: The HTTP status indicates whether the upload was successful.
      Additionally the response includes an ETag header containing an MD5 hash of the
      submitted payload. This can be compared to the submitted payload to ensure data
      integrity of the upload

        ## Example Payload

        The following demonstrates a (redacted) multipart payload suitable for submitting to the PUT
        endpoint. Most programming languages should have provisions for assembling a multipart
        payload like this without having to do so manually.

        ```
        --17de1ed8f01442b2a2d7a93506314b76
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="metadata"
        Content-Type: application/json
        {"veteranFirstName": "Jane",
        "veteranLastName": "Doe",
        "fileNumber": "012345678",
        "zipCode": "97202",
        "source": "MyVSO",
        "docType": "21-22"}
        --17de1ed8f01442b2a2d7a93506314b76
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="content"
        Content-Type: application/pdf
        <Binary PDF contents>
        --17de1ed8f01442b2a2d7a93506314b76
        Content-Disposition: form-data; name="attachment1"
        Content-Type: application/pdf
        <Binary PDF attachment contents>
        --17de1ed8f01442b2a2d7a93506314b76--
        ```

        This PUT request would have an overall HTTP Content-Type header:

        ```
        Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=17de1ed8f01442b2a2d7a93506314b76
        ```
        
        Note that the Content-Disposition parameter "name" in each part must be the expected values
        "metadata", "content", "attachment1"..."attachmentN"

        that the document package has been transmitted, but possibly not validated. Any errors with the
        document package (unreadable PDF, etc) may cause the status to change to “error”.
