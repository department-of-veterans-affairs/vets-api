# Developer Setup

In hybrid mode, you will run vets-api natively, but run Postgres and Redis in Docker. By doing so you avoid any challenges of installing these two software packages and keeping them upgraded to the appropriate version.



## Base Setup

1. Install Docker as referenced in the [Docker setup instructions](docker.md).

1. Follow the [Native setup instructions](native.md), but skip any steps related to installing Postgres, Postgis, Redis or ClamAV. You *will* need to install the other dependencies such as pdftk.

1. Configure vets-api to point to the Docker-ized dependencies. Add the following to `config/settings.local.yml`:

```
database_url: postgis://postgres:password@localhost:54320/vets_api_development?pool=4
test_database_url: postgis://postgres:password@localhost:54320/vets_api_test?pool=4

redis:
  host: localhost
  port: 63790
  app_data:
    url: redis://localhost:63790
  sidekiq:
    url: redis://localhost:63790
```

*Note: If you have local instances of Postgres or Redis that were only for use by vets-api, you can stop them to save system resources.*

## Running

Prior to EKS, ClamAV (the virus scanner) was deployed in the same process as Vets API. With EKS, ClamAV has been extracted out into itâ€™s own service. Locally you can see the docker-compose.yml config for clamav.

TODO: Running clamav natively, as we did in Vets API master still needs to be configured. For the time being, please run via docker:

Please set the [clamav intitalizer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/k8s/config/initializers/clamav.rb) initializers/clamav.rb file to the following:

``` 
# ## If running hybrid
if Rails.env.development?
   ENV["CLAMD_TCP_HOST"] = "0.0.0.0"
   ENV["CLAMD_TCP_PORT"] = "33100"
 end
```

### Options
#### Option 1: Run ONLY clamav via Docker

You can either run:
`docker-compose -f docker-compose-clamav.yml up` - this will run ONLY clamav via docker

After that, follow the native instructions and run `foreman start -m all=1`

#### Option 2: Run ALL dependencies via docker (Clamav, Redis, Postgres)
`docker-compose -f docker-compose-deps.yml up` - this will run all dependencies via docker

After that, follow the native instructions and run `foreman start -m web=1 all=0`

You should then be able to navigate to http://localhost:3000/v0/status in your browser and start interacting with the API. Changes to the source in your local directory will be reflected automatically via a docker volume mount, just as they would be when running rails directly.

1. Start vets-api as per the [native running instructions](running_natively.md).
