### 1. Production Bug Template

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Generate a production bug ticket for vets-api with these details:
- Service: vets-api
- Issue: 500 errors increasing in mobile appointments endpoint
- Priority: High
- Affected: Mobile app users
- Evidence: DataDog dashboard showing error spike
```

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Issue Type
Bug

## Service/Component
vets-api - Mobile API (modules/mobile)

## Priority
High

## Description
Production 500 errors increasing on mobile appointments endpoint (/mobile/v0/appointments). Error rate has increased from baseline 0.1% to 3.2% over the past 2 hours.

## Current Behavior
- Mobile appointments endpoint returning HTTP 500 errors
- Error rate: 3.2% (up from 0.1% baseline)
- Affecting appointment retrieval for mobile users
- Backend service calls timing out

## Expected Behavior
- Appointments endpoint should return successful responses
- Error rate should remain below 0.5%
- Response time should be under 2 seconds

## Impact Assessment
- **Users Affected**: Mobile app users trying to view appointments
- **Business Impact**: Veterans cannot access appointment information
- **Estimated Affected Users**: ~1,200 users per hour
- **Severity**: Service degradation affecting core functionality

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Make GET request to `/mobile/v0/appointments`
2. With valid authenticated user
3. Observe intermittent 500 responses

## Metrics/Evidence
- DataDog Dashboard: [vets-api Mobile Endpoints](https://link-to-dashboard)
- Error logs: Check CloudWatch for stack traces
- Response time metrics showing degradation
- Time range: Past 2-4 hours

## Proposed Solution
1. Investigate recent deployments (past 4 hours)
2. Check external service dependencies (VEText, VAOS)
3. Review error logs for root cause
4. Consider circuit breaker activation if upstream issue

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Root cause identified and documented
- [ ] Error rate returns to baseline (<0.5%)
- [ ] Response times return to normal (<2s)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured to prevent recurrence
- [ ] Post-incident review completed if warranted

## Labels
`bug`, `production`, `mobile`, `high-priority`, `api-endpoints`
```

### 2. Performance Issue Template

**Copilot Prompt:**
```
Generate a performance issue ticket for:
- Service: vets-api database

- Impact: API response times increased
```

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Issue Type
Performance

## Service/Component
vets-api - PostgreSQL Database

## Priority
Medium

## Description
Slow query performance detected on claims table queries causing increased API response times. Several queries taking >5 seconds when normal response time is <500ms.

## Current Behavior
- Claims-related API endpoints responding slowly
- Database queries taking 5-15 seconds
- Connection pool exhaustion during peak hours
- Slow query logs showing expensive operations

## Expected Behavior
- Claims queries should complete in <500ms
- API response times should remain under 2 seconds
- Database connection pool should remain healthy

## Impact Assessment
- **Affected Services**: Claims API, Appeals API
- **User Experience**: Slow page loads, timeouts
- **Peak Hour Impact**: More severe during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM ET)
- **SLA Impact**: Response times exceeding 5-second threshold

## Metrics/Evidence
- DataDog Database Dashboard: [PostgreSQL Performance](https://link)
- Slow query log analysis needed
- APM traces showing database bottlenecks
- Connection pool metrics showing saturation

## Proposed Solution
1. Analyze slow query logs from past 24 hours
2. Identify missing indexes or inefficient queries
3. Review recent schema changes or migrations
4. Consider query optimization or index additions
5. Evaluate connection pool configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Slow queries identified and optimized
- [ ] Missing indexes added if appropriate
- [ ] Query performance returns to <500ms average
- [ ] Connection pool metrics healthy
- [ ] Documentation updated with findings

## Labels

- [ ] IP analysis initiated

## Investigation Steps
1. Analyze authentication logs for patterns
2. Identify targeted user accounts
3. Geo-locate suspicious IP addresses
4. Check for compromised credentials in known breaches
5. Review rate limiting effectiveness
6. Consider temporary IP blocking if warranted

## Acceptance Criteria
