# RFCs Directory

This directory contains **Request for Comments (RFCs)** for Simple Forms API and any other Veteran Facing Forms related endeavors. RFCs are used to propose, discuss, and document significant changes, improvements, or additions to the system. They provide a structured way to present ideas, gather feedback, and ensure that technical decisions are well-documented and understood across the team.

## What is an RFC?

An **RFC** (Request for Comments) is a document that outlines a proposal for a change or new feature in the project. It serves as a formalized way to communicate the intent, design considerations, and implementation plan. RFCs are intended to encourage collaboration, transparency, and detailed discussion before major changes are introduced.

## When to Create an RFC

You should create an RFC when:

- Introducing a new feature or functionality that significantly impacts the system.
- Making architectural changes or refactoring existing components.
- Proposing changes that require discussion and feedback from multiple stakeholders.
- Establishing new standards, practices, or protocols within the project.

## RFC Format

An RFC should follow the standard structure outlined below:

### RFC Structure:

1. **Title**: Clearly state the objective of the RFC (e.g., "Monitoring Strategy for S3 PDF Upload Service").
2. **Summary**: Provide a brief overview of what the RFC is about.
3. **Background**: Explain the context, motivation, and existing problems that led to this proposal.
4. **Proposal**: Describe the proposed change or solution in detail. Include design considerations, diagrams, and examples if necessary.
5. **Technical Details**: Outline the technical implementation, including tools, dependencies, and relevant code snippets.
6. **Impact**: Explain the benefits, potential drawbacks, and any risks associated with the proposal.
7. **Open Questions**: List any unresolved questions or areas where feedback is needed.
8. **Feedback Request**: Specify which parts of the RFC you need feedback on and any particular stakeholders who should review it.
9. **Appendices/References**: Include any supporting documents, links, or references.

### Example RFC Template:

```markdown
# RFC <RFC Number>: <Descriptive Title>

## Summary
[Brief overview of the proposal]

## Background
[Explanation of the current state, motivation for change, and context]

## Proposal
[Detailed description of the proposed change, including technical specifics]

## Technical Details
[Outline of implementation, tools, code examples, etc.]

## Impact
[Potential benefits, risks, or changes required]

## Open Questions
[Unresolved questions or areas needing input]

## Feedback Request
[Specific areas where feedback is needed]

## Appendices/References
[Links to additional documentation, diagrams, etc.]
```

## Naming Conventions

Each RFC should be named using the following convention:

**`<rfc-number>-<short-descriptive-title>.md`**

### Guidelines:

- **RFC Number**: Sequential, zero-padded numbers (e.g., `0001`, `0002`, `0003`). This helps in tracking and organizing RFCs.
- **Short Descriptive Title**: Use a brief, hyphenated, lowercase description of the topic (e.g., `monitoring-s3-pdf-service`, `api-performance-improvements`).

### Example:

- `0001-monitoring-s3-pdf-service.md`
- `0002-api-performance-improvements.md`

## Workflow for Creating and Submitting an RFC

1. **Create a New RFC File**: Use the naming convention described above and place the new file in the `docs/rfcs` directory.
2. **Draft the RFC**: Write the RFC using the standard template and provide as much detail as possible.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a PR with your new RFC. In the PR description, briefly summarize the proposal and specify any areas where you need feedback.
4. **Gather Feedback**: Encourage discussion and collaboration on the PR. Address feedback by updating the RFC as needed.
5. **Approval and Merge**: Once the RFC is approved, merge the PR. The RFC is now considered an accepted part of the project documentation.

## Reviewing RFCs

When reviewing an RFC, consider the following:

- **Clarity**: Is the proposal clearly explained, and does it make sense?
- **Impact**: Will the change have a positive impact? Are there any potential risks or downsides?
- **Feasibility**: Is the proposed solution technically sound? Are there any challenges that should be addressed?
- **Alternatives**: Are there other approaches that should be considered?

## FAQ

**Q: Can an RFC be changed after it's been merged?**

- Yes, but any significant changes should go through the RFC process again. Submit a new RFC to propose modifications to an existing one, referencing the original RFC number.

**Q: What happens if an RFC is rejected?**

- If an RFC does not receive approval, it can be updated based on feedback and resubmitted. Alternatively, it may be closed if the proposed changes are not deemed suitable.
