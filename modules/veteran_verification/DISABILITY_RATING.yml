    Veteran Verification - Disability Rating

    ## Background

    The use-case of this API is to allow third-parties to access the disability rating of a Veteran after receiving authorization to do so using an Open ID Connect flow.

    The Disability Rating API passes requests through to EVSS, the Electronic Veterans Self Service, and formats the response into consumable data.

    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized using a Bearer token issued through an OpenID Connect service to permit access to Veteran information to third-party applications. The token should be submitted as an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>`.

    ### Disability Rating Request

    Allows a third-party application to request a Veteran's disability rating with the authorization of the Veteran.

    1. Client Request: GET https://dev-api.va.gov/services/veteran_verification/v0/disability_rating
       *  Provide the Bearer token as a header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the Veteran's disability rating
