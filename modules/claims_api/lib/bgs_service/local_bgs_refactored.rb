  # @deprecated Use {BGSClient.perform_request} instead. There ought to be a
  #   clear separation between the single method that performs the transport to
  #   BGS and any business logic that invokes said transport. By housing that
  #   single method as an instance method of this class, we encouraged
  #   business logic modules to inherit this class and then inevitably start to
  #   conflate business logic back into the transport layer here. There was a
  #   particularly easy temptation to put business object state validation as
  #   well as the dumping and loading of business object state into this layer,
  #   but that should live in the business logic layer and not here.
