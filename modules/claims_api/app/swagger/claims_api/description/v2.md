It also lets Veterans or their authorized representatives:
 - Digitally submit supporting documentation for disability compensation claims
 - Retrieve information such as status for any claim, including pension and burial
 - Retrieve power of attorney (POA) status for individuals and Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs)
 - Retrieve intent to file status

## Background
The Benefits Claims API offers faster establishment and enhanced reporting for several VA claims and forms. Using this API provides many benefits, such as:
 - Automatic claim and POA establishment
 - Direct establishment of disability compensation claims in Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) to avoid unnecessary manual processing and entry by Veteran Service Representatives (VSRs)
 - Faster claims processing by several days
 - End-to-end claims status and result tracking by claim ID

Forms not supported by the Benefits Claims API are submitted using the [Benefits Intake API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits?version=current), which places uploaded PDFs into the Centralized Mail Portal to be manually processed.

## Technical Overview
This API accepts a payload of requests and responses on a per-form basis, with the payload identifying the form and Veteran. Trackable responses provide a unique ID which is used with the appropriate GET endpoint to track a submission’s processing status.

### Attachment and file size limits
There is no limit on the number of files a payload can contain, but size limits do apply.
 - Uploaded documents cannot be larger than 11" x 11"
 - The entire payload cannot exceed 5 GB
 - No single file in a payload can exceed 100 MB

### Authentication and authorization
To make an API request, follow our [authentication process](https://developer.va.gov/explore/authorization?api=claims) to receive an [OAuth token](https://oauth.net/2/).

#### Representative authorization
Accredited representatives may make requests to the Claims API on behalf of Veterans that they represent. To make API requests on behalf of a Veteran, representatives must:
 - be [accredited with the VA Office of the General Counsel](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp)
 - be [authenticated](https://developer.va.gov/explore/authorization?api=claims) using an identity-proofed account
 - be the current Power of Attorney (POA) on record for the Veteran (accredited representatives can use the ‘/veterans/{veteranId}/power-of-attorney’ endpoint to check a Veteran’s current POA)

#### Finding a Veteran's unique VA ID
The Claims API uses a unique Veteran identifier to identify the subject of each API request. This Veteran identifier can be retrieved by an authenticated Veteran or an accredited representative by passing name, DOB, and SSN to the ‘/veteran-id’ endpoint. This identifier should then be used as the Veteran ID parameter in request URLs.

*Note: though Veteran identifiers are typically static, they may change over time. If a specific Veteran ID suddenly responds with a ‘404 not found’ error, the identifier may have changed. It’s a good idea to retrieve the current identifier for each Veteran periodically.*

### POA Codes
Veteran representatives receive their organization’s POA code. If they are the assigned POA for a Veteran, that Veteran will have a matching POA code. When a claim is submitted, this API verifies that the representative and Veteran codes match against each other and the codes in the [Office of General Council (OGC) Database](https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/index.asp).

Use the [Power of Attorney endpoint](#operations-Power_of_Attorney-post2122) to assign or update POA status. A newly appointed representative may not be able to submit forms for a Veteran until a day after their POA code is first associated with the OGC data set.

### Test data for sandbox environment use
[Test data](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts.md) is used for all forms in the sandbox environment and for 21-526 submissions in the staging environment.

### Claim and form processing
Claims and forms are first submitted by this API and then established in VBMS. A 200 response means only that your claim or form was submitted successfully. To see if your submission is processed or has reached VBMS, you must check its status using the appropriate GET endpoint and the ID returned with your submission response.

A “claim established” status means the claim has reached VBMS. In sandbox, submissions can take over an hour to reach “claim established” status. In production, this may take over two days.
