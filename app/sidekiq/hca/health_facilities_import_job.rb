# HealthFacilitiesImportJob
#

# This Sidekiq job imports and synchronizes VA health facility data from the Lighthouse API
# into the HealthFacility table. It ensures that the local database reflects the current
# set of health facilities, including removing facilities that no longer exist in the source.

# Why:
# - Keeps our health facility data up-to-date for downstream services and user-facing features.
# - Ensures data integrity by removing stale records.
# - Handles edge cases where environments may have missing reference data (see ensure_std_states_populated).

# How:
# - Fetches all health facilities from Lighthouse, paginating as needed.
# - Maps and transforms the data to match our schema.
# - Upserts (inserts or updates) all current facilities.
# - Deletes any facilities not present in the latest import.
# - Logs progress and errors for monitoring and debugging.
