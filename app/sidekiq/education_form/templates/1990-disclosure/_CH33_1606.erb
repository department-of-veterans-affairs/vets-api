* I will not receive a Montgomery GI Bill (Active Duty-Chapter 30 or Selected reserve-Chapter 1606) 'Kicker' under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, unless I was eligible for the kicker at the time I applied and I relinquished that benefit for the Post-9/11 GI Bill-Chapter 33.
* When choosing the effective date, I understand that benefits for training under Chapter 33 are not payable prior to that date.
* My election is irrevocable and may not be changed.
