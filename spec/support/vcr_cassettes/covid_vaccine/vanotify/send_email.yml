        up to stay informed about COVID-19 vaccines at VA. When we have new information
        to share about our COVID-19 plans and your vaccine options, we''ll send you
        updates by email or text.\r\n\r\n## When can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at VA?\r\nAt
        this time, we still have a limited amount of vaccines.\u00a0We\u2019re working
        to determine how quickly we can begin to offer vaccines to\u00a0people other
        than Veterans who are already enrolled in VA health care.\u00a0We\u00a0appreciate
        your patience as we\u00a0prepare to offer more vaccines.\r\n\r\nYour employer,
        pharmacy, healthcare provider\u2019s office, or local public health officials
        may offer you a COVID-19 vaccine. We encourage you to take the first opportunity
        you have to get a vaccine at the most convenient location for you.\r\n\r\nIf
        you\u2019re a Veteran who\u2019s not currently receiving health care through
        VA,\u00a0[find out if you''re eligible for VA health care and how to apply](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/?utm_source=VANotify&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_19_vaccine).\r\n__Note:__
        We\u2019ll contact you when you can get a vaccine. You don\u2019t need to
        call or go in person to a VA health facility.\r\n\r\n## How will VA contact
        me when I can get a COVID-19 vaccine?\r\nYour closest VA health facility may
        contact you by phone, email, or text message. If you\u2019re eligible and
        want to get a vaccine, we encourage you to respond.\r\n\r\nBut before you
        provide any personal information or click on any links, be sure the call,
        email, or text is really from VA.\r\n- Text messages will always come from
        __53079__.\r\n- Emails will always come from a __va.gov__ email address.\r\n-
        If someone calls you from VA and you don\u2019t recognize the phone number,
        ask for a number to call them back. Then call your local VA health facility
        to verify.\r\n\r\nYour facility may invite you to get a vaccine in different
        ways:\r\n- They may invite you to a large vaccination event, like a drive-thru
        clinic.\r\n- They may offer you a specific date and time to get a vaccine.\r\n-
        They may ask you to schedule an appointment.\r\n\r\nYou can also get updates
        and answers to common questions on our main [COVID-19 vaccines page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/?utm_source=VANotify&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=covid_19_vaccine).\r\n\r\n---\r\nYou\u2019re
