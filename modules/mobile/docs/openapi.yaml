        When listing messages, the response for each message will include most but not all of the message attributes.
        Specifically, the message body and attachment information is not included. Those attributes can be obtained by
        getting the specific message resource.

            When this endpoint responds with a 200, it includes a Content-Version header. The frontend is expected to store that value and include it as the `current_version` query param. When the `current_version` is omited or does not match the server's current version, the server responds with a 200 status, the newest version of the translations file, and the header including the newest version id. If the `current_version` matches the server's current version, the server responds with 204 and no content.

      description: Creates a new residential or mailing address for a user. Calling
        this endpoint is the second step in adding a new address for a user. The first
        step is to call the address validation endpoint to check if an address is
        valid. If it is valid you'll receive a 'addressMetaData' object back with
        the addresses confidence score. This object should then be included along
        with the new address in the request body. If the user wishes to continue with
        an 'invalid' address then the 'validationKey' should be passed along with
        the new address in the request body. This lets the underlying service know
        that an invalid address be passed through.
