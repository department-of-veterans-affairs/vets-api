# Add a new feature toggle here to ensure that it is initialized in all environments.
#
# Features are enabled by default in the test environment and disabled by default in other environments.
# To default a feature to enabled in development, set the `enable_in_development` key to true.
#
# The description should contain any relevant information for an admin who may toggle the feature.
#
# The actor_type should be either `user` for features you want to be "sticky" for a logged in user (default)
#  or `cookie_id` of you wish to use the Google Analytics id as the unique identifier.

# Sorted using http://yaml-sorter.herokuapp.com/
