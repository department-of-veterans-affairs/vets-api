    Caseflow Appeals Status
    
    ## Background
    
    This API is being provided as a proof of concept of a general-purpose VA 
    API gateway. The use case is to allow authorized third-party developers to
    request the status of veterans benefit appeals.

    The Appeals API passes data through to Caseflow, a case management system. Caseflow
    accepts a header with the veteran's SSN and returns the current status of
    their appeals.

    Because this application is designed to allow third-parties to request
    information on behalf of a veteran, we are not using VAAFI headers or SSOe.

    ## Design
    
    ### Authorization
    
    API requests are authorized by means of a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header
    with name "apikey".

    ### Status Request
    
    Allows a client to check benefit appeals status

    1. Client Request: GET https://api.vets.gov/services/appeals/v0/appeals
        * Provide the veteran's SSN as the X-VA-SSN header
    
    2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the current status of appeals
