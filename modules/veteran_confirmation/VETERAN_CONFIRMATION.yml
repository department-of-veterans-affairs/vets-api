    The Veteran Confirmation API allows you to confirm Veteran status for a given person. This can be useful for offering Veterans discounts or other benefits.

    The API will only return “Confirmed” or “Not Confirmed”. 

    ## Quickstart Guide
    ### 1. Get Access Credentials
    Get started by filling out the form on the [Apply for VA Lighthouse Developer Access](https://developer.va.gov/apply) page.

    After submitting a request, you will receive your credentials for using the API in the Development environment, which allows you to try it out with mock data before moving to the Production environment.

    ### 2. Test the API
    In the endpoint documentation below, we've provided a curl command builder for trying out the API before implementation with your app.

    ### 3. Build your app
    The base URI for the Veteran Confirmation API in the Development environment is:
    
    https://dev-api.va.gov/services/veteran_confirmation/v0

    Check out some of our [sample apps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients). Please visit our VA Lighthouse [Support portal](https://developer.va.gov/support) should you need further assistance.

    ### 4. Show us a quick demo and get access to the Production environment
    After building your app, we ask that you give us a quick demo before we set you up with production credentials. Please see the [Path to Production](https://developer.va.gov/go-live) page for more details.

    ## Authorization
    This API requires an API key in combination with identifiable information for the person being confirmed listed below. API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token provided in an HTTP header with name `apikey`. Including more information has a better chance of making a match and returning a Confirmed status. 
    #### Required information:
    * First Name  
    * Last Name  
    * Date of Birth  
    * Social Security Number 

    #### Optional information:
    * Middle Name  
    * Gender
    
    ## Reference
    ### Development vs. Production Data
    APIs accessed via the Development environment are using the same underlying logic as VA’s production APIs; only the underlying data store is different. 

    ### Rate Limiting 
    We implemented basic rate limiting of 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this quota, your request will return a 429 status code. You may petition for increased rate limits by emailing and requests will be decided on a case by case basis.
