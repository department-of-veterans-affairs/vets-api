    **IMPORTANT**: This is a DRAFT version of the VA Facilities API, and it does not yet contain any of the endpoints currently present in v0.

    ## Background

    This draft version of the VA Facilities API has only a single endpoint (`/nearby`) that allows you to query which VA health (VHA) facilities are nearby, given a specified location (address or lat/long) and desired drive time (up to 90 minutes, in 10 minute increments).

    ## Design

    ### Base URLs
    
    The base URLs for the VA Facilities API in the various environments are:
    - Development: `https://dev-api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/v1`
    - Production: `https://api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/v1`

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name `apikey`.

    ### Active Status
    
    VHA facilities can be temporarily deactivated for a variety of reasons. If a facility comes back from this API with `"active_status": "T"`, it is not currently operating. `"active_status": "A"` indicates normal operations at a facility.
    
    ### Mobile Facilities
    
    VHA has a set of mobile facilities that move regularly within a region. If a facility comes back from this API with `"mobile": "true"`, the latitude/longitude and address should be considered inaccurate. To get the exact current location, please call the number listed.

  #     description: |
  #       *This is a draft specification and not an available endpoint.*

  #       Retrieve all facilities contained within the specified bounding box. Bounding box is
  #       specified as four parameters lng1, lat1, lng2, lat2. Relative ordering of longitude and
  #       latitude parameters is unimportant.

  #       Additionally one can filter the facilities within the bounding box by type and available
  #       services. Only facilities of type "health" and "benefits" may be filtered by available
  #       services.

  #       Alternatively, one can retrieve multiple facilities by id using this endpoint by making a
  #       request with a comma-separated list of ids like `?ids=id1,id2`. When requesting facilities
  #       in bulk by `id`, the API will return as many ids as it can find matches for and omit any
  #       ids where there is no match. It will not return an HTTP error code if it is unable to match
  #       a requested `id`. Clients may supply ids up to the limit their HTTP client enforces for
  #       URI path lengths -- usually 2,048 characters.

  #       One of the `ids` parameter, the `bbox` parameter, or the `lat` and `lng` parameters are
  #       *required* to query this API. Requests without one or the other will return `400 Bad Request`.

  #       Results of this operation are paginated. JSON responses include pagination information
  #       in the standard JSON API "links" and "meta" elements. GeoJSON responses include pagination
  #       information in the "Link" header.

      summary: Query which VA health (VHA) facilities are nearby, given a specified location and desired drive time
      description: |
        Retrieve all facilities contained within an isochrone (a polygon composed of the area
        reachable in a certain amount of time from a central location) based on passing in a
        combination of `street_address`, `city`, `state`, and `zip` or `lat` and `lng` required
        parameters along with `drive_time`.

        Additionally one can filter the facilities within the isochrone by type and available
        services. Only facilities of type "health" and "benefits" may be filtered by available
        services.

        Results of this operation are paginated. Responses include pagination information
        in the standard JSON API "links" and "meta" elements.

        Also in the "meta" element is information about the drive time band that the requested location 
        fell within for each the facility included in the response. The values of drive_time_band_min and 
        drive_time_band_max are in minutes. For example, a facility returned with a matched drive_time_band_min 
        of 10 and drive_time_band_max of 20 is a 10 to 20 minute drive from the requested location.

        The facility information returned by `/nearby` is a small subset of the information returned by `/facilities`.
        Please use `/facilities` to see detailed information.

  #       *This is a draft specification and not an available endpoint.*

  #       Retrieve drive time bands for all available facilities in a single operation, formatted as either a GeoJSON
  #       FeatureCollection or as a CSV.

  #       Alternatively, one can retrieve drive time bands for a specific facility using `/facilities/{id}/drive_time_bands`.

  #       The facility information returned by `/drive_time_bands` is a small subset of the information returned by `/facilities`.
  #       Please use `/facilities` to see detailed information.
