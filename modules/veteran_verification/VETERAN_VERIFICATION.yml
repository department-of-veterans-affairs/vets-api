    The Veteran Verification API allows you to confirm the Veteran status for a given person, or retrieve a Veteran's service history or disability rating.

    When confirming Veteran Status, the Status endpoint will return "Confirmed" or "Not Confirmed".

    ## Quickstart Guide

    ### 1. Get Access Credentials

    Get started by filling out the form on the [Apply for VA Lighthouse Developer Access](/apply) page.

    After submitting a request, you will receive your credentials for using the API in the Sandbox environment, which allows you to try it out with mock data before moving to the Production environment.

    ### 2. Test the  API

    In the endpoint documentation below, we've provided a curl command builder for trying out the API before implementation with your app.

    ### 3. Build your app

    The base URI for the Veteran Verification API in the Sandbox environment is:

    https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/veteran_verification/v0

    Check out some of our [sample apps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/tree/master/samples/). Please visit our VA Lighthouse [Support portal](/support) should you need further assistance.

    ### 4. Show us a quick demo and get set up in the Production environment

    After building your app, we ask that you give us a quick demo before we set you up with production credentials. Please see the [Path to Production](/go-live) page for more details.

    ## Authorization
    This API uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) standard (OAuth 2) to allow the person being confirmed to log in and provide digital consent. API requests are authorized using a Bearer token issued through an OpenID Connect service. The token should be submitted as an Authorization header in the form Bearer <token>.

    See our [Authorization Guide](/explore/verification/docs/authorization) for more details

    ## JWS Signing
    It is possible to receive responses for certain endpoints in this API in the form of a compact JSON Web Signature (JWS). To receive the signed version of the payload, set the `Accept` header to `application/jwt` for an endpoint supporting that functionality. Instead of a JSON response, a token conforming to [RFC 7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) and [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) unless errors are encountered, which will return JSON.

    To validate the signature of the returned token, capture the `kid` (key id) from the decoded token, call the `/keys` endpoint, and match the `kid` against the same field in the returned keyset to retrieve a public key. The matching public key from the set can be used for verification using the algorithm stated in the `alg` key.

    The `/keys` endpoint returns a JWK keyset compliant with [RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517), plus one additional field called `pem`, which is the pem version of the public key.

    ## Reference

    ### Sandbox vs. Production Data
    APIs accessed via the Sandbox environment are using the same underlying logic as VAâ€™s production APIs; only the underlying data store is different.

    ### Rate Limiting
    We implemented basic rate limiting of 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this quota, your request will return a 429 status code. You may petition for increased rate limits by emailing, and requests will be decided on a case by case basis.

                Possible values include the concatenation of Pay Plan Code and Pay Grade Code.
                Pay Plan Code is represented as a two-character code, and can be one of five values:
                 - CC (Commissioned Corps)

                Pay Grade Code is a value between 01 and 10.
                Pay Plan Code is concatenated with Pay Grade Code to determine the full Pay Grade value, with the leading character (M or C) stripped from Pay Plan Code.

The original character of discharge for other purposes was either "bad-conduct" or "other-than-honorable". "honorable-absence-of-negative-report" represents an unreported character of service that DoD classifies as honorable.
