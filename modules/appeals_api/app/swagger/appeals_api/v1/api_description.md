The Decision Reviews API allows you to interact with a veteran’s decision reviews, also known as benefit appeals. This API provides a secure and efficient alternative to paper or fax submissions.

> * For more information on the Decision Review process, including the different types of Decision Reviews, please see [this informative page on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/).

> * The Decision Reviews API supports the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) process only. Appeals going through the legacy Appeal process cannot be managed through this API. Learn more about AMA [here](https://benefits.va.gov/benefits/appeals.asp).
