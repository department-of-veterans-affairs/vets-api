### Configuring ClamAV antivirus

Prior to EKS, ClamAV (the virus scanner) was deployed in the same process as Vets API. With EKS, ClamAV has been extracted out into itâ€™s own service. Locally you can see the docker-compose.yml config for clamav.

1. In settings.local.yml add the following:

```
clamav:
  mock: false
  host: 'clamav'
  port: '3310'
```

These setting are the default, so they be can removed as well
