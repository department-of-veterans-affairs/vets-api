    <p>Dear <%= user.first_name %> <%= user.last_name %></p>
    <p>We're sorry. Something went wrong when we tried to submit your application to add or remove a dependent on your VA benefits (VA Forms 21-686c and 21-674).</p>
    <p>Your online application didn’t go through because of a technical problem and we aren’t able to access your application. We're sorry for the extra work, but you’ll need to go back and apply again at https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents/add-remove-form-686c/.</p>
    <p>If you have general questions about adding or removing a dependent, you can call Veteran Benefits Assistance at 800-827-1000. We’re here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your service,</p>
    <p>VA.gov</p>
