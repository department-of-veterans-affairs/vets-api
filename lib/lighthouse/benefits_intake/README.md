# Lighthouse Benefits Intake

Allows a programmatic submission of a form via uploaded PDF to the Lighthouse Benefits Intake API.
The Lighthouse API returns a success on receiving a valid upload, but that does not indicate a successful submission to VBMS.
This service also contains a job to perform polling to the API for the status of a submission.
To allow a form/team agnostic approach to this submission and polling a handler is registered
to provide the uuids to query and processing for handling the response

## Prerequisites

For local development you need to acquire a sandbox/staging API key:
https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-intake/sandbox-access

## Configuration

Within `config/settings.yml` there is an entry for `lighthouse.benefits_intake`.
The values are stored in AWS Parameter store, and can be overriden for local development.

The running of the job is controlled in `lib/periodic_jobs.rb`

A handler can be registered with the status job in different ways:
1. from within `config/initializers/benefits_intake_submission_status_handlers.rb` directly providing the key and class
2. from within a modules engine initialization, eg. `modules/pensions/lib/pensions/engine.rb`

## Usage Examples

To perform an upload of a form and attachments:

```ruby
intake_service = BenefitsIntake::Service.new
metadata = intake_service.valid_metadata?(metadata:)
form_path = intake_service.valid_document?(document:)
intake_service.request_upload
payload = {
  upload_url: intake_service.location,
  document: form_path,          # generated pdf path for the form
  metadata: metadata.to_json,   # metadata is a Hash
  attachments: attachment_paths # generated pdf path for each attachment; each checked with `valid_document?`
}
intake_service.perform_upload(**payload)
```

To register a handler with the submission status job:

```ruby
# Register our Pension Benefits Intake Submission Handler
::BenefitsIntake::SubmissionStatusJob.register_handler(Pensions::FORM_ID, Pensions::BenefitsIntake::SubmissionHandler)
```
