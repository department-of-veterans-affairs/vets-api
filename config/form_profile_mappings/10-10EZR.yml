  # Due to the way the frontend ArrayBuilder pattern inherently works, we need to have a snapshot of associations
  # data prior to the user making any changes on the frontend. We'll then use this snapshot to essentially
  # check the difference between this data and the data submitted with the form. This will save us from making 
  # another request to VES to get the latest associations data.
