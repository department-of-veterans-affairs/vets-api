class AccreditedOrganization < ApplicationRecord
  # Represents an accredited organization as defined by he OGC accreditation APIs. Until a form of soft deletion is
  # implemented, these records will only reflect organization with active accreditation.
  #
  # Key notes:
  # 1. The core record attributes are populated from the OGC accreditation APIs, not the files found at
  #   https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/ that Veteran::Service::Organization uses.
  # 2. The intent of raw_address is to store the address as supplied by OGC for diffing purposes to avoid excess API
  #   calls. Those addresses are not verified and do not contain latitude and longitude. The address information stored
  #   on the record comes from the Lighthouse Address Validation API so that geolocation searching is supported
  #   for the Find A Representative feature.
  # 3. The ogc_id is the id from the source table within OGC. It can be used to interact with their show endpoints
  #   and may be nice to have for troubleshooting purposes.
