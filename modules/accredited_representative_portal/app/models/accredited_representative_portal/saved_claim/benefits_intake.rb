        # Types of Benefits Intake API claims differ only by the value of a
        # couple attributes. `.define_claim_type` is a narrow & rigid interface
        # for defining new claim types. This interface discourages bespoke
        # customization and encourages a thoughtful pause in the case that some
        # new requirement presents friction for it.
        #
        # `form_id` can be found on much of the object graph: `saved_claims`,
        # `persistent_attachments`, and `form_submissions`. It is generally
        # overworked as both a way to indicate the actual form involved as well
        # as a way to distinguish what processing the form undergoes. We need a
        # way to deal with this overworking.
        #
        # Concretely, we have `FORM_ID` to distinguish which background job will
        # poll Benefits Intake API for status updates, and `PROPER_FORM_ID` to
        # set the datapoint in Benefits Intake API of which actual form we're
        # uploading. We could potentially forego `PROPER_FORM_ID` in favor of
        # the caller knowing how to map from `FORM_ID`, but the situation is
        # perhaps delicate enough that all callers should have their attention
        # drawn to the fact that `PROPER_FORM_ID` is the alternative for dealing
        # with this overworking problem.
