 Allows for generating and downloading a veteran's health records

##### Available routes

| Resource  | Description | Params |

| GET /health_records | Returns a health record | doctype: pdf/txt (must be bone of 'pdf or test' - defaults to pdf) |

##### Note

The call to generate a report should make the PDF more or less available right away.
It is possible however that a call to generate the report at MHV takes longer than time it takes for user to click the download report.
In this scenario, it is as yet unclear what the error returned will be from MHV. And unclear what special handling is prudent.
This is an example of something we will have to discover more in testing.
