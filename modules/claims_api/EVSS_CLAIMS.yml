    Benefit Claims Status

    ## Background

    This API is being provided as a proof of concept of a general-purpose VA  API gateway. The use case is to allow authorized third-party developers to request the status of a Veteran's benefit claims.

    The Benefit Claim API passes data through to Electronic Veterans Self Service, EVSS. EVSS uses VAAFI to authenticate requests. Consumers of this API not using OAuth will need to pass the minimum VAAFI headers to this service to retrieve records.

    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized by means of a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header
    with name "apikey".

    ### List Statuses Request

    Allows a client to check claims status from EVSS.

    1. Client Request: GET https://api.va.gov/services/claims/v0/claims
        * Provide the Veteran's SSN as the X-VA-SSN header
        * Provide the VA username of the person requesting the claim status as the X-VA-User header
        * Provide the Veteran's First Name as X-VA-First-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Last Name as X-VA-Last-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Birth Date as X-VA-Birth-Date in the iso8601 format
        * Provide the Veteran's EDIPI as X-VA-EDIPI

    2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the current status of claims

    ### Single status request

    Allows a client to retrieve claim status by EVSS id.

    1. Client Request: GET https://api.va.gov/services/claims/v0/claims/123123
        * Provide the Veteran's SSN as the X-VA-SSN header
        * Provide the VA username of the person requesting the claim status as the X-VA-User header
        * Provide the Veteran's First Name as X-VA-First-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Last Name as X-VA-Last-Name
        * Provide the Veteran's Birth Date as X-VA-Birth-Date in the iso8601 format
        * Provide the Veteran's EDIPI as X-VA-EDIPI

    2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the current status of the requested claim
