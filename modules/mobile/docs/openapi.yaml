      summary: /v0/user/addresses/validate
      description: Validates a residential or mailing address for a user. Calling this endpoint is the first step in adding a new address for a user. If the address is valid you'll receive a 'addressMetaData' object back with the addresses confidence score. This object should then be included along with the new address in the request body. If the user wishes to continue with an 'invalid' address then the 'validationKey' should be passed along with the new address in the request body. This lets the underlying service know that an invalid address be passed through.

      description: Updates a user's residential or mailing address. Calling this endpoint is the second step in adding a new address for a user. The first step is to call the address validation endpoint to check if an address is valid. If it is valid you'll receive a 'addressMetaData' object back with the addresses confidence score. This object should then be included along with the new address in the request body. If the user wishes to continue with an 'invalid' address then the 'validationKey' should be passed along with the new address in the request body. This lets the underlying service know that an invalid address be passed through.
