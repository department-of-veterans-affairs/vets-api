# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    body_html: >
      <p>We're sorry. Something went wrong when we tried to submit your application to add or remove a dependent on your VA benefits (VA Forms 21-686c and 21-674).</p>
      <p>Your online application didn’t go through because of a technical problem and we aren’t able to access your application. We're sorry for the extra work, but you’ll need to go back and apply again at https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents/add-remove-form-686c/.</p>
      <p>If you have general questions about adding or removing a dependent, you can call Veteran Benefits Assistance at 800-827-1000. We’re here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET.</p>
