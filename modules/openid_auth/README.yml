    Oauth Validation for internal 3rd Party Services

    ## Background



    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized using a Bearer token issued through an OpenID
    Connect service to allow third-party applications. The token should be
    submitted as an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>`.

    ### Token Validation Request

    Allows a third-party application to request the validated token and VA Identifier ICN for an individual:

    1. Client Request: GET https://api.vets.gov/internal/auth/v0/validation
       * Provide the Bearer token as a header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    2. Status Response: A JSON API object with the individual's validated token and VA identifier ICN
