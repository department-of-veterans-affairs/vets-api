    Oauth Validation for internal 3rd Party Services

    ## Background



    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized using a Bearer token issued through an OpenID
    Connect service to allow third-party applications. The token should be
    submitted as an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>`.

    ### Token Validation Request

    Allows a third-party application to request the validated token along with actor and launch characteristics:

    1. Client Request: POST https://api.va.gov/internal/auth/v2/validation
       * Provide the Bearer token as a header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
       * Provide a body parameter for appropriate audience for validation can be a string or an array
         aud: https://api.va.gov/services/fhir
       * Provide a body parameter to specify if audience must match one provided by the user (defaults to false)
         strict: true/false

    2. Status Response: A JSON API object with the individual's validated token and VA identifier ICN
