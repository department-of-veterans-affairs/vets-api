    The Veteran Verification API allows you to confirm the Veteran status for a given person, or retrieve a Veteran's service history or disability rating.

    When confirming Veteran Status, the Status endpoint will return "Confirmed" or "Not Confirmed".

    ## Quickstart Guide

    ### 1. Get Access Credentials

    Get started by filling out the form on the [Apply for VA Lighthouse Developer Access](/apply) page. 
    
    After submitting a request, you will receive your credentials for using the API in the Development environment, which allows you to try it out with mock data before moving to the Production environment.
    
    ### 2. Test the  API
    
    In the endpoint documentation below, we've provided a curl command builder for trying out the API before implementation with your app.

    ### 3. Build your app

    The base URI for the Veteran Verification API in the Development environment is:

    dev-api.va.gov/services/veteran_verification/v0

    Check out some of our sample apps located on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/tree/master/samples/). Please visit our VA Lighthouse [Support portal](/support) should you need further assistance.

    ### 4. Show us a quick demo and get set up in the Production environment

    After building your app, we ask that you give us a quick demo before we set you up with production credentials. Please see the [Path to Production](/go-live) page for more details.

    ## Authorization
    This API uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) standard (OAuth 2) to allow the person being confirmed to log in and provide digital consent. API requests are authorized using a Bearer token issued through an OpenID Connect service. The token should be submitted as an Authorization header in the form Bearer <token>.
    
    See our [OAuth Guide](/explore/verification/docs/authorization) for more details


    ## Reference
    
    ### Development vs. Production Data
    APIs accessed via the Development environment are using the same underlying logic as VA’s production APIs; only the underlying data store is different.
  
    ### Rate Limiting
    We implemented basic rate limiting of 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this quota, your request will return a 429 status code. You may petition for increased rate limits by emailing   and requests will be decided on a case by case basis.
