# COVID Research

The COVID Research module currently serves one very small function. It exists to process Corona Virus Research volunteer submissions. There is currently **only one** route in this entire module.

## Metrics

There are a few basic metrics around this functionality:

- submissions received (`api_covid_research_volunteer_create_total`)
- submissions delivered to `genISIS` (`api_covid_research_volunteer_deliver_form_total`)
- invalid submissions (`api_covid_research_volunteer_create_fail`)
- `genISIS` delivery failures (`api_covid_research_volunteer_deliver_form_fail`)

## Architecture

There are four main pieces that are used in support of this feature/behavior:

- Vets Website
- Vets API
- Sidekiq
- `genISIS`

This module sits between `va.gov` and `genISIS`. Its purpose is to receive submissions from `vets-website`, validate them and then deliver the data to `genISIS`.

## Data Flow

The data flow for this module is pretty simple. There is currently a single form that is handled here. The module validates the submission, delivers a confirmation email and submits it to `genISIS` for long term storage.

1. Form received from va.gov ([#create](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/app/controllers/covid_research/volunteer/submissions_controller.rb))
2. Form validated against the JSON Schema ([#valid?](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/app/services/covid_research/volunteer/form_service.rb))
   1. Form encrypted and enqueued in Sidekiq ([#queue_delivery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/app/services/covid_research/volunteer/form_service.rb))
   2. Confirmation email delivery enqueued in Sidekiq ([#create](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/app/controllers/covid_research/volunteer/submissions_controller.rb))
3. Form data delivered to `genISIS` (via Sidekiq) ([#deliver_form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/app/services/covid_research/volunteer/genisis_service.rb))
4. Confirmation email delivered (via Sidekiq) ([#perform](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/app/workers/covid_research/volunteer/confirmation_mailer_job.rb))

## Schema Changes

This module currently has a few specs that are dependent on the data format. That data format is defined outside of this module (in `vets_json_schema`) and therefore there is some coordination required if that data format changes.

If the [schema](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema/blob/master/dist/COVID-VACCINE-TRIAL-schema.json) changes then matching changes need to be made to the following fixtures:

- [valid-submission.json](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/spec/fixtures/files/valid-submission.json)
- [encrypted-form.json](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/spec/fixtures/files/encrypted-form.json)
- [genisis-mapping.json](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/spec/fixtures/files/genisis-mapping.json)

Updating `valid-submission.json` and `genisis-mapping.json` should be fairly straight forward the `encrypted-form.json` fixture is a different story. The best way to update that file is to use the rails console and encrypt the **updated** `valid-submission.json` fixture. There is a [Rake task](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/covid_research/lib/tasks/covid_research_tasks.rake) that can be run to generate a new version of `encrypted-form.json`.
