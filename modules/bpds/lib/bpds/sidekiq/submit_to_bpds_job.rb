# This module serves as a namespace for classes and modules related to BPDS (presumably a service or subsystem).
#
# BPDS contains submodules and classes that encapsulate the logic for interacting with the BPDS service,
# including background job processing, submission tracking, and monitoring.
module BPDS
  # The Sidekiq module namespace for background job processing.
  module Sidekiq
    # SubmitToBPDSJob is a Sidekiq job responsible for submitting a SavedClaim to the BPDS service.
    #
    # This job performs the following actions:
    # - Checks if the BPDS service feature is enabled via Flipper; skips processing if disabled.
    # - Initializes the submission context for the specified SavedClaim.
    # - Prevents duplicate submissions by checking the latest submission status.
    # - Decrypts the provided payload to extract participant and file information.
    # - Submits the claim data to the BPDS service and records the submission attempt.
    # - Tracks submission success or failure using a monitoring service.
    # - Handles and logs errors, recording failed attempts and re-raising exceptions.
    # - On exhaustion of Sidekiq retries, logs the failure and records it in the submission attempts.
    #
    # @example Enqueue a submission job
    #   SubmitToBPDSJob.perform_async(saved_claim_id, encrypted_payload)
