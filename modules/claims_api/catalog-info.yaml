  description: The Benefits Claims API is a suite of services that enables VA and third-party consumers to build applications that let Veterans and their authorized representatives view and submit certain claims and claim-related information to the VA. We provide the ability to auto-establish claims by submitting structured data that can return realtime validations, allowing for better data quality.
