    # @!attribute segment_identifier
    #   @return [String] identifier that is used to ensure a unique
    #     key on each deployment location record
    # @!attribute begin_date
    #   @return [Date] the date on which a Service member's deployment began. This is a
    #     generated field. It is the date of the first location event in a series of location events
    #     in which the amount of time between events is 21 days or less. However, for the Navy
    #     these events must also be of 14 days or greater in length. Example for the Navy: A
    #     member deploys for 7 days and then deploys three days later for 15 days, then this
    #     would create two separate deployment dates. However, if both deployments lasted 15
    #     days, then it would be considered one long deployment.
    # @!attribute end_date
    #   @return [Date] the date on which a Service member's deployment ended. This is a
    #     generated field. It is the date of the final location event in a series of location events
    #     in which the amount of time between events is 21 days or less. However, for the Navy
    #     these events must also be of 14 days or greater in length. Example for the Navy: A
    #     member deploys for 7 days and then deploys three days later for 15 days, then this
    #     would create two separate deployment dates. However, if both deployments lasted 15
    #     days, then it would be considered one long deployment.
    # @!attribute project_code
    #   @return [String] this data element provides the granularity to differentiate between
    #     the various contingencies. Currently that granularity is not available, so it is
    #     defaulted to 9GF for OCO contingencies.
