# Copilot Instructions for `vets-api`

> Use these instructions when reviewing pull requests in this repository. Prefer concise, actionable comments with links to the lines in the diff. When confident, suggest exact code edits.

---

## Project Overview

`vets-api` is a Ruby on Rails API that powers VA.gov, serving as a wrapper around VA data services for veterans.

* **Stack:** Ruby on Rails (API-only), Sidekiq for background jobs, RDS (PostgreSQL), Faraday HTTP client with custom middleware, Kubernetes (EKS), Datadog APM/Logs, AWS ELB in the request path.
* **Primary consumer**: `vets-website`, the frontend repo that powers VA.gov.
* **Constraints:** PII/PHI must be protected. External services are often the failure pointâ€”timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers matter. Avoid long blocking work in web requests.

---

## Review Priorities (in order)

1. **Correctness & Safety**
   - No leaking PII/PHI in logs, errors, or metrics.
   - Idempotency for endpoints that create/modify records.
   - Validate inputs (type, format, bounds). Return consistent error shapes.

2. **Reliability & Timeouts**
   - Faraday: set explicit timeouts, retries (with backoff), and circuit breaking where applicable.
   - Avoid increasing app-wide timeouts to mask slow dependencies. Prefer upstream timeouts â‰¤ request timeout.
   - Sidekiq: move slow/fragile calls out of request path when feasible.

3. **Performance**
   - Watch for N+1 queries; use `includes`/`preload`.
   - Add DB indexes for new query filters and foreign keys. Avoid full-table scans in hot paths.

4. **Security**
   - Use strong params; forbid mass assignment.
   - Escape output; avoid stringly SQL; prefer Arel or parameterized queries.
   - Secrets/config must come from env/SSM, not source.

5. **Maintainability**
   - Keep classes small; follow Sandi Metz's rules (objects < 100 lines; methods < 5 lines when practical; max 3 args; no long conditionals).
   - Follow Rails conventions (fat models are OK up to a point; avoid fat controllers; extract service objects/jobs).

## Architecture & Directory Structure

Some apps inside `vets-api` are packaged as Rails Engines ("modules"), located in `vets-api/modules/`. Others live in `vets-api/app/`.

**Common directories:**
* Controllers â†’ `app/controllers` or `modules/<name>/app/controllers`
* Models â†’ `app/models` or `modules/<name>/app/models`
* Serializers â†’ `app/serializers` or `modules/<name>/app/serializers`
* Services â†’ `app/services` or `modules/<name>/app/services`

**Environment-specific settings:** Use `rubyconfig/config`. Add settings to **three files** in alphabetical order:
* `config/settings.yml`
* `config/settings/test.yml`
* `config/settings/development.yml`

---

## HTTP Clients (Faraday) â€” Required Patterns

Always set timeouts, retries, and error handling:

```ruby
Faraday.new(url: base, request: { timeout: 8, open_timeout: 2 }) do |f|
  f.request :retry, max: 2, interval: 0.25, backoff_factor: 2,
               methods: %i[get post put patch], retry_statuses: [502, 503, 504]
  f.response :raise_error
  f.response :json, content_type: /json/
  # f.use CustomMiddleware::CircuitBreaker (if available)
  f.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end
```

* Validate and normalize timeouts in code paths that override defaults.
* Wrap calls with clear error handling; map upstream errors to domain-specific errors.
* **Breakers**: Circuit breaker for external API calls.
* **Betamocks**: Mock external HTTP services in development and test.

---

## Controllers & Error Handling

* Endpoints are **RESTful**, versioned under `/v0/`, `/v1/`, etc.
* Use **strong parameters** for input validation.
* Authentication via **JWT** or **OAuth2**.
* Use consistent error envelope:
  ```json
  { "error": { "code": "string", "message": "human-readable", "details": {...} } }
  ```
* Return appropriate status codes (422 for validation, 404 for missing, 429 for throttling, 5xx only for unknown/transient server issues).
* Prefer `render json:` with serializers or JBuilder; don't build JSON by string concatenation.

---

## Background Jobs (Sidekiq)

* Background jobs in `app/sidekiq` or `modules/<name>/app/sidekiq`
* Jobs must be **idempotent** and **retry-safe**. Guard against duplicate work.
* Use `sidekiq_options retry: X, dead: false` with a finite retry policy.
* Long-running external calls belong in jobs, not controllers. Pass only minimal identifiers, not large payloads.

---

## Testing & Feature Toggles

* Framework: **RSpec** (`spec/` or `modules/<name>/spec/`)
* Fixtures: **FactoryBot**
* Feature toggles: **Flipper**
  * Always test both **enabled** and **disabled** states.
  * **Never** call `Flipper.enable` or `Flipper.disable` in tests.
  * Always stub inline with:
    ```ruby
    allow(Flipper).to receive(:enabled?).with(:feature_flag).and_return(true)
    ```
* Enable logging in tests: `RAILS_ENABLE_TEST_LOG=true bundle exec rspec path/to/spec.rb` â†’ Logs go to `log/test.log`
* Add unit tests for service/job logic and integration tests for controllers.
* Include tests for time-dependent logic (freezing time) and failure modes (upstream 5xx, timeouts).

---

## Database & Migrations

* New foreign keys must be indexed. Add partial indexes for scoped uniqueness when applicable.
* **Index updates**: Always in their **own migration file**. Must use `algorithm: :concurrently` and include `disable_ddl_transaction!` to prevent table locking.
* Write **reversible** migrations; avoid locking large tables during business hours.
* Prefer optimistic locking or explicit version checks in race-prone updates.
* Data migrations â†’ must be written as **rake tasks**, not Rails migrations.

---

## Security & PII Protection

* **Never log** PII/PHI in logs, errors, or metrics (e.g., `response_body`, `user.icn`).
* **Never commit secrets or keys**. Secrets/config must come from env/SSM, not source.
* Authentication/authorization must be explicit; never trust client-provided roles/flags.
* Input validation against allowlists; reject unknown fields when strict.
* **User Context**: Always use authenticated user context (`@current_user`) for data access.
* **Veteran Verification**: Verify veteran status before accessing benefits-related data.

---

## VA-Specific Patterns

* **BGS Integration**: Use BGS (Benefits Gateway Service) for veteran benefits data through established service patterns.
* **MVI Integration**: Use MVI (Master Veteran Index) for veteran identity and demographic data.
* **Form Submissions**: Follow established patterns for form submission processing and validation.
* **Time & TZ**: All persistence in UTC. Business logic defaults to **America/New_York** if business-driven.

---

## Logging, Metrics, Tracing

* **Logging**: Never log PII/PHI, tokens, secrets. Redact by default (`[FILTERED]`). Log at most: endpoint, status, latency, correlation/request IDs.
* **Datadog APM**: Add spans around external calls; set tags for upstream service, status, and retry count.
* **Metrics**: Emit counters for success/failure; histograms for latency by upstream.

## Code Review Guidelines â€” Ruby & Rails Specific

### Ruby shorthand syntax
âœ… Use `{ exclude: }` if a local variable exists.
ðŸš« Do **not** expand to `{ exclude: exclude }`.
ðŸš« Do **not** flag shorthand as unclear.

### Flipper usage in tests
ðŸš« Never call `Flipper.enable` or `Flipper.disable`.
âœ… Always stub inline with pattern above.

### ActiveRecord index migrations

#### Isolate index changes
- If a migration includes `add_index` or `remove_index`, it must only include index changes.
- Do **not** combine index changes with other table modifications in the same migration.

#### Avoid locking
- A migration that includes `add_index` or `remove_index` must also:
  - Use `algorithm: :concurrently`
  - Include `disable_ddl_transaction!`
  
This prevents table locking during deployment.

## What To **Praise**
- Deleted code; reduced complexity; moved blocking IO to jobs; added tests for failure paths; added indexes with evidence; improved logging redaction.

## What To **Question or Block**
- Introduces or increases request timeout without addressing upstream.
- Adds external HTTP call in request path without timeouts/retries.
- Logs or outputs any PII/PHI.
- Adds N+1 queries or removes needed indexes.
- Non-idempotent POST/PUT without safeguards.
- Large migrations without safety plan.

## Comment Style Examples

- _"Consider adding `includes(:association)` to avoid N+1 on `index`."_
- _"This Faraday client lacks explicit `timeout`/`open_timeout`. Recommend `timeout: 8, open_timeout: 2` and retry with backoff."_
- _"This new column is filtered by `WHERE status = ...`. Please add an index on `status` or a composite if combined with `user_id`."_
- _"Potential PII in this log line (`user_email`). Please remove or redact."_
- _"Controller does heavy IO; move to Sidekiq job and respond 202 Accepted with a job ID."_

## Tips for Copilot

* Stick to established patterns and structure.
* Reuse existing helpers and services.
* Keep code clear and concise.
* If prompted to create an issue, use `department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team` repository.
* Prefer PORO service objects under `app/services` for complex flows.
* Centralize Faraday config/middleware; avoid ad-hoc clients per call site.
