module MyHealth
  # This module provides overrides for user identity fields (such as ICN, EDIPI, etc.)
  # in development environments to simplify local testing. It redefines certain
  # methods on the `current_user` object to return fixed, testable values.
  #
  # Usage:
  # Include this module in a controller or base controller where `current_user`
  # is defined. In development mode, the overridden values will be returned
  # for user attributes such as `icn`, `mhv_correlation_id`, `edipi`, and `last_name`.
  #
  # The `current_user` object is not replacedâ€”-only the specified methods are
  # dynamically overridden, preserving all other behaviors of the user object.

    ##
    # Returns the current user, with selected identity fields overridden
    # for development environment only.
    #
    # @return [Object] The current user with overridden attribute methods
    #
