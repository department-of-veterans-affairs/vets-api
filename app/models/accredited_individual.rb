class AccreditedIndividual < ApplicationRecord
  # Represents an accredited individual (attorney, claims agent, representative) as defined by he OGC accreditation
  # APIs. Until a form of soft deletion is implemented, these records will only reflect individuals with active
  # accreditation.
  #
  # Key notes:
  # 1. The core record attributes are populated from the OGC accreditation APIs, not the files found at
  #   https://www.va.gov/ogc/apps/accreditation/ that Veteran::Service::Representative uses.
  # 2. The intent of raw_address is to store the address as supplied by OGC for diffing purposes to avoid excess API
  #   calls. Those addresses are not verified and do not contain latitude and longitude. The address information stored
  #   on the record comes from the Lighthouse Address Validation API so that geolocation searching is supported
  #   for the Find A Representative feature.
  # 3. The representative type should not have a POA code assigned. Representatives should only be associated with the
  #   POA codes of the AccreditedOrganizations they are accredited with.
  # 4. Attorneys and claims agents should have a POA code and should not be accredited with any AccreditedOrganization
  # 5. The ogc_id is the id from the source table within OGC. It can be used to interact with their show endpoints
  #   and may be nice to have for troubleshooting purposes.
