  CLINTON ROBERTSON



  NOTE: This general and special authorization to disclose was developed to comply with the provisions regarding disclosure of medical and other information under
  P.L. 104-191 ("HIPAA"); 45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164; 42 U.S.C. §290dd-2; 42 C.F.R. part 2, and State Law.

 PRIVACY ACT NOTICE: The VA will not disclose information collected on this form to any source other than what has been authorized under the Privacy Act of 1974
 or Title 38, Code of Federal Regulations 1.576 for routine uses (i.e., civil or criminal law enforcement, congressional communications, epidemiological or research
 studies, the collection of money owed to the United States, litigation in which the United States is a party or has an interest, the administration of VA programs and
 delivery of VA benefits, verification of identity and status, and personnel administration) as identified in the VA system of records, 58VA21/22/28 Compensation,
 Pension, Education, and Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Records - VA, published in the Federal Register. Your obligation to respond is voluntary. However,
 if the information including your Social Security Number (SSN) is not furnished completely or accurately, the source to which this authorization is addressed may not be

 able to identify and locate your records, and provide a copy to VA. VA uses your SSN to identify your claim file. Providing your SSN will help ensure that your records
 are properly associated with your claim file. Giving us your SSN account information is voluntary. Refusal to provide your SSN by itself will not result in the denial of
 benefits. The VA will not deny an individual benefits for refusing to provide his or her SSN unless the disclosure of the SSN is required by Federal Statute of law in
 effect prior to January 1, 1975 and still in effect.


 If you do not revoke this authorization, it will automatically expire in 12 months from the date you sign and date the form. Signing this form is voluntary, but failing to
 sign it, or revoking it before we receive necessary information could prevent an accurate or timely decision on your claim, and could result in denial or loss of benefits.
 Although the information we obtain with this form is almost never used for any purpose other than those stated above, the information may be disclosed by VA without
 your consent if authorized by Federal laws such as the Privacy Act.


 Under the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) (Public Law 105-277), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ensures that agencies, when practicable,
 provide for the option of electronic maintenance, submission of disclosure of information and for the use and acceptance of electronic signatures. GPEA states that
 electronic records submitted or maintained in accordance with the procedures developed by OMB, or electronic signature or other forms of electronic authentication used

 in accordance with such procedures, "shall not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability merely because such records are in electronic form" (Public Law 105-277,
 section 1707).

 RESPONDENT BURDEN: We need this information and your written authorization to obtain your treatment records to help us get the information required to process

 your claim. Title 38, United States Code, allows us to ask for this information. You can provide this authorization by signing VA Form 21-4142. Federal law permits
 sources with information about you to release that information if you sign a single authorization to release all your information from all possible sources. We will make
 copies of it for each source. A few States, and some individual sources of information, require that the authorization specifically name the source that you authorize to
 release personal information. In those cases, we may ask you to sign one authorization for each source and we may contact you again if we need you to sign more
 authorizations. We estimate that you will need an average of 5 minutes to review the instructions, find the information and complete this form. VA cannot conduct or

 sponsor a collection of information unless a valid OMB control number is displayed. Valid OMB control numbers can be located on the OMB Internet Page at www.
 reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain. If desired, you may call 1-800-827-1000 to get information on where to send comments or suggestions about this form. If you use the
 Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD), the Federal relay number is 711.


 PATIENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT: I HEREBY AUTHORIZE the sources listed in Section IV, to release any information that may have been obtained in connection
 with a physical, psychological or psychiatric examination or treatment, with the understanding that VA will use this information in determining my eligibility to veterans
 benefits I have claimed. I understand that the source being asked to provide the Veterans Benefits Administration with records under this authorization may not require me
 to execute this authorization before it provides me with treatment, payment for health care, enrollment in a health plan, or eligibility for benefits provided by it. I
 understand that once my source sends this information to VA under this authorization, the information will no longer be protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but will be
 protected by the Federal Privacy Act, 5 USC 552a, and VA may disclose this information as authorized by law. I also understand that I may revoke this authorization in

 writing, at any time except to the extent a source of information has already relied on it to take an action. To revoke, I must send a written statement to the VA Regional
 Office handling my claim or the Board of Veterans' Appeals (if my claim is related to an appeal) and also send a copy directly to any of my sources that I no longer wish
 to disclose information about me. I understand that VA may use information disclosed prior to revocation to decide my claim.

 PRIVACY ACT NOTICE: The VA will not disclose information collected on this form to any source other than what has been authorized under the Privacy Act of

 1974 or Title 38, Code of Federal Regulations 1.576 for routine uses (i.e., civil or criminal law enforcement, congressional communications, epidemiological or research
 studies, the collection of money owed to the United States, litigation in which the United States is a party or has an interest, the administration of VA programs and
 delivery of VA benefits, verification of identity and status, and personnel administration) as identified in the VA system of records, 58VA21/22/28 Compensation,

 However, if the information including your Social Security Number (SSN) is not furnished completely or accurately, the health care provider to which this authorization is

 ensure that your records are properly associated with your claim file. Giving us your SSN account information is voluntary. Refusal to provide your SSN by itself will

 not result in the denial of benefits. The VA will not deny an individual benefits for refusing to provide his or her SSN unless the disclosure of the SSN is required by
 Federal Statute of law in effect prior to January 1, 1975 and still in effect.
