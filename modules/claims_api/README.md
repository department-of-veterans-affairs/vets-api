## OpenApi/Swagger Doc Generation
This api uses [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag) to build the OpenApi/Swagger docs that are displayed in the [VA|Lighthouse APIs Documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current).  To generate/update the docs for this api, navigate to the root directory of `vets-api` and run the following command ::
- `rake rswag:claims_api:build`

Documentation for v2 is now structured in an "environment layout", allowing us to preview documentation in our lower environments before releasing the updated `swagger.json` to the sandbox and production environments. v2 is now structured to include a `/dev` and `/production` file directory which will be served in the appropriate environments via the `v2/api_controller`.

To remove documentation for both environments, use the default `document: false` provided via rswag. To remove documentation from the production environment only, use `production: false`.

The implementation of `production: false` required additional changes to the [rswag_override](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/spec/rswag_override.rb) file. Due to this, the [rswag](https://github.com/rswag/rswag) repo should be checked periodically to update the `example_group_finished` method if needed.
