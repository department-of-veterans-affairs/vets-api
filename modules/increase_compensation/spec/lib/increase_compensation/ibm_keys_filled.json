  "VETERAN_BENEFICIARY_REMARKS":"Starship Troopers (1997), directed by Paul Verhoeven, is a cinematic masterpiece that brilliantly disguises razor-sharp satire as a bombastic sci-fi action flick. On the surface, it’s a thrilling tale of humanity’s war against giant arachnid aliens on distant planets, complete with jaw-dropping practical effects, explosive battles, and a cast of charismatic young actors."
