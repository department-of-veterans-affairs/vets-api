    Veteran Verification - Veteran Confirmation

    ## Background

    The use-case of this API is to allow third-parties
    to request confirmation from the VA of an individual's Veteran status after
    receiving authorization to do so using an Open ID Connect flow.

    The Veteran Confirmation API passes requests through to eMIS, the Enterprise
    Military Information Service, and formats the response into consumable data.

    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized using a Bearer token issued through an OpenID
    Connect service to allow third-party applications. The token should be
    submitted as an `Authorization` header in the form `Bearer <token>`.

    ### Veteran Status Request

    Allows a third-party application to request the VA confirm the Veteran Status of an
    authorized individual:

    1. Client Request: GET https://api.va.gov/services/veteran_verification/v0/status
       * Provide the Bearer token as a header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    2. Status Response: A JSON API object with the individual's veteran status
