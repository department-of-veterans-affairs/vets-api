    <h1>We've added you to our VA coronavirus research volunteer list</h1>

    <p>Thank you again for joining us in this important effort.</p>

    <p>If we think you may be eligible for one of our research studies, we'll call you at the number you listed in the sign-up form. The caller ID will appear as **Department of VA**. We’ll talk with you about all of the details of the study, including possible risks, to help you decide whether you want to join.</p>

    <p>**Remember:**</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some studies have specific requirements. So it may be weeks or months before there's a study that you may be eligible to join.</li>

      <li>We'll never ask for an ID number or for your financial, credit, or bank account information over the phone.</li>
      <li>It's always your choice to join a study, and you can leave a study at any time. Your decision to join a study or not won’t affect your VA health care or any of your VA benefits or services in any way.</li>
    </ul>
