    Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) caseflow appeals status.

    ## Background

    Use this API to request the status of a Veteran's benefits claim appeal.

    The Appeals API passes data through to Caseflow, a case management system. Caseflow
    accepts a header with the Veteran’s SSN and returns the current status of their appeals.

    Because this application is designed to allow third-parties to request information on behalf of a Veteran, we are not using VA Authentication Federation Infrastructure (VAAFI) headers or Single Sign On External (SSOe).

    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name "apikey".

    ### Status Request

    Allows a client to check benefit appeals status

    1. Client Request: GET https://dev-api.va.gov/services/appeals/v0/appeals
        * Provide the Veteran's SSN as the X-VA-SSN header
        * Provide the VA username of the person requesting the appeals status as the X-VA-User header

    2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the current status of appeals
