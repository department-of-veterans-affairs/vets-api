          Count of different types of prescriptions. "active" contains prescriptions that have a `refillStatus` of active,
          submitted, providerHold, activeParked, refillinprocess, and/or prescriptions that have a tracking number 
          associated with them. If a prescriptions does not meet the criteria for "active", it appends it's `refillStatus` to the list. 
          If a refillStatus is not present in any prescription, it will not be included in this list.
          See `refillStatus` enum for all possible values. "isRefillable" is a separate count of prescriptions with `isRefillable` set to true. 
          A prescription can be counted in both `isRefillable` and any other status count.
        example:
            active: 1
            isRefillable: 1
            discontinued: 1
            expired: 2
            historical: 3
            pending: 1
            transferred: 2
            submitted: 1
            hold: 1
            unknown: 2
            total: 14
