## ClamAV Antivirus Configuration
### EKS

Prior to EKS, ClamAV (the virus scanner) was deployed in the same process as Vets API. With EKS, ClamAV has been extracted out into itâ€™s own service. Locally you can see the docker-compose.yml config for clamav.

**TODO**: Running clamav natively, as we did in Vets API master still needs to be configured. For the time being, **please run via docker**:

Please set the [clamav intitalizer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/k8s/config/initializers/clamav.rb) initializers/clamav.rb file to the following:

``` 
## If running via docker
if Rails.env.development?
  ENV["CLAMD_TCP_HOST"] = "clamav"
  ENV["CLAMD_TCP_PORT"] = "3310"
end
```

After that, run the make/docker-compose commands per usual.
