  "additionalInformation": "The traumatic event I experienced during my service has had a profound and lasting impact on my mental health. Since the incident, I have struggled with symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, which have significantly affected my daily life and well-being.\nAfter the event, I began to notice intense feelings of fear and helplessness whenever I was reminded of the experience. These flashbacks were frequent and uncontrollable, often triggered by loud noises, crowded places, or even certain smells. The emotional distress caused by these flashbacks would leave me feeling overwhelmed, panicked, and unable to function. At times, it felt as though I was reliving the traumatic experience, and I had difficulty distinguishing the past from the present.\nI also developed chronic insomnia. I found it difficult to fall asleep, and when I did manage to sleep, I was frequently awakened by nightmares of the traumatic event. These disturbed nights left me feeling exhausted and unable to perform basic tasks during the day. The lack of rest contributed to a decline in my physical health, as I struggled with fatigue, headaches, and an overall sense of lethargy.\nSocially, I became increasingly withdrawn. I avoided interactions with friends, family, and even fellow service members, as I felt disconnected and unable to trust anyone. My relationships suffered as I became irritable, short-tempered, and emotionally distant. I found it hard to experience joy or satisfaction in anything, including activities I once enjoyed, such as hobbies and socializing. I rarely leave my house, even if it's to go get groceries.\nSince then I've found fewer and fewer reasons to live. I've lost all interest in the things I once loved, and I struggle to find any joy in the present moment. I've become increasingly isolated, and I often feel like I'm just going through the motions of life. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up.
