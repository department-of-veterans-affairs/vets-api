    ## Background

    This API provides information about physical VA facilities. Information available includes
    geographic location, address, phone, hours of operation, and available services.

    VA operates several different types of facilities, the types represented in this API include:
    - Health facilities
    - Benefits facilities
    - Cemeteries
    - Vet Centers

    To read an FAQ on how wait times are calculated, click the "For more information" link on [this page](https://www.accesstocare.va.gov/PWT/SearchWaitTimes).

    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name "apikey".

    ### Response Formats

    Clients may request several response formats by setting the `Accept` header.
    - application/json - The default JSON response format complies with JSON API. This media type is *not* available for bulk requests using the `/facilities/all` endpoint. It will return `406 Not Acceptable`. .
    - application/vnd.geo+json - GeoJSON-compliant format, representing each facility as a Feature with a Point geometry.
    - text/csv - Available for the bulk download operation only. Some structured fields are omitted from the CSV response.

    ### Response Elements

    Some data elements within the response are only present for facilities of a given type:
    - The patient satisfaction scores contained in the `satisfaction` element are only applicable
      to VA health facilities.
    - The patient wait time values contained in the `wait_times` element are only applicable to
      VA health facilities.
    - The list of available services in the `services` element is only applicable to VA health and
      benefits facilities.

    ### Mobile Facilities

    VHA has a set of mobile facilities that move regularly within a region. 
    If a facility comes back from this API with `"mobile": "true"`, the latitude/longitude and address should be considered inaccurate.
    To get the exact current location, end consumers should contact the mobile facility directly.

    ### Active Status

    VHA facilities can be temporarily closed for a variety of reasons.
    If a facility comes back from this API with `"active_status": "T"`, it is not currently operating.
    `"active_status": "A"` indicates normal operations at a facility.

      summary: Query facilities based on a geographic bounding box and optional attribute filters
      description: |
        Retrieve all facilities contained within the specified bounding box. Bounding box is
        specified as four parameters long1, lat1, long2, lat2. Relative ordering of longitude and
        latitude parameters is unimportant.

        Additionally one can filter the facilities within the bounding box by type and available
        services. Only facilities of type "health" and "benefits" may be filtered by available
        services.

        Alternatively, one can retrieve multiple facilities by id using this endpoint by making a
        request with a comma-separated list of ids like `?ids=id1,id2`. When requesting facilities
        in bulk by `id`, the API will return as many ids as it can find matches for and omit any
        ids where there is no match. It will not return an HTTP error code if it is unable to match
        a requested `id`. Clients may supply ids up to the limit their HTTP client enforces for
        URI path lengths -- usually 2,048 characters.

        One of the `ids` parameter, the `bbox` parameter, or the `lat` and `long` parameters are
        *required* to query this API. Requests without one or the other will return `400 Bad Request`.

        Results of this operation are paginated. JSON responses include pagination information
        in the standard JSON API "links" and "meta" elements. GeoJSON responses include pagination
        information in the "Link" header.
