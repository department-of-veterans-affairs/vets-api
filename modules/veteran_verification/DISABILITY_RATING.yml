    Veteran Verification - Disability Rating

    ## Backgroun

    This API is provided as a proof of concept for a general-purpose VA
    API that allows Veterans to provide authorization to a third-party to access
    information on their behalf. The use-case of this API is to allow third-parties
    to access the service history of a Veteran after receiving authorization to
    do so using an Open ID Connect flow.

    The Disability Rating API passes requests through to eMIS, the Enterprise
    Military Information Service, and formats the response into consumable data.

    ## Design

    ### Authorization

    API requests are authorized using a Bearer token issued through an OpenID
    Connect service to permit access to Veteran information to third-party
    applications. The token should be submitted as an `Authorization` header
    in the form `Bearer <token>`.

    ### Disability Rating Request

    Allows a third-party application to request a Veteran's disability rating with
    the authorization of the Veteran.

    1. Client Request: GET https://api.vets.gov/services/veteran_verification/v0/diability_rating
       *  Provide the Bearer token as a header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    2. Service Response: A JSON API object with the Veteran's disability rating
