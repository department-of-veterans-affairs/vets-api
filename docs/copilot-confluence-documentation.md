#### 2.2 Template Generation
- **Capability**: Creates consistent, structured templates
- **Application**: Standardizes ticket format across team
- **Benefit**: Reduces cognitive load and ensures completeness

#### 2.3 Context Awareness
- **Capability**: Adapts output based on provided context
- **Application**: Customizes tickets for specific services/scenarios
- **Example**: Includes PostgreSQL-specific steps when mentioned

#### 2.4 Best Practice Integration
- **Capability**: Incorporates industry best practices
- **Application**: Automatically includes SRE considerations
- **Example**: Adds rollback procedures, monitoring requirements

### Supported Ticket Types

| Ticket Type | Support Level | Complexity | Time Savings |
|------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Infrastructure Change | Excellent | High | 70% |
| Incident Response | Excellent | High | 65% |
| Monitoring Setup | Good | Medium | 60% |
| Security Updates | Good | Medium | 55% |
| Performance Optimization | Good | High | 60% |
| General Maintenance | Excellent | Low | 75% |

## 3. Limitations and Edge Cases

### 3.1 Technical Limitations

#### Context Window Constraints
- **Limitation**: Limited understanding of large codebases
- **Impact**: May miss system-specific requirements
- **Mitigation**: Provide explicit context in prompts

#### Accuracy Concerns
- **Limitation**: ~70% technical accuracy without review
- **Impact**: Generated content requires validation
- **Mitigation**: Always review and verify technical details

#### Security Considerations
- **Limitation**: No awareness of sensitive data
- **Impact**: Risk of exposing secrets if not careful
- **Mitigation**: Never include credentials/PII in prompts

### 3.2 Functional Limitations

#### Team-Specific Standards
- **Limitation**: Unaware of internal conventions
- **Impact**: Output may not match team standards
- **Mitigation**: Create team-specific prompt templates

#### Tool Integration
- **Limitation**: No direct integration with ticketing systems
- **Impact**: Manual copy-paste required
- **Mitigation**: Use as template generator, not direct integration

#### Dynamic Requirements
- **Limitation**: Cannot fetch real-time system state
- **Impact**: Metrics and current state must be added manually
- **Mitigation**: Use prompts for structure, add specifics manually

### 3.3 Edge Cases

| Edge Case | Description | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Complex Dependencies | Multi-system changes | Break into multiple tickets |
| Emergency Incidents | P1 incidents requiring immediate action | Use abbreviated prompts |
| Compliance Requirements | Regulated environments | Add compliance checklist manually |
| Custom Workflows | Non-standard processes | Create specialized prompts |

## 4. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 4.1 Effective Prompt Structure

```
[Context] + [Specific Request] + [Constraints] + [Output Format]
```

**Example**:
```
Given a Rails application using PostgreSQL on AWS,
create an infrastructure change ticket
for upgrading the database version,
including rollback procedures and testing steps
```

### 4.2 Prompt Optimization Techniques

#### Be Specific
- ✅ "Create a P2 incident ticket for authentication service with 30% error rate"
- ❌ "Create an incident ticket"

#### Provide Context
- ✅ Include: Technology stack, environment, team size
- ❌ Assume Copilot knows your infrastructure

#### Iterate and Refine
- Start with basic prompt
- Add details progressively
- Save successful patterns

### 4.3 Common Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Service-Specific Templates
```
For [SERVICE_NAME] running on [PLATFORM],
create a [TICKET_TYPE] ticket
addressing [SPECIFIC_ISSUE]
```

#### Pattern 2: Incident Response
```
Generate P[SEVERITY] incident response ticket:
Service: [SERVICE]
Symptom: [DESCRIPTION]
Impact: [USER_IMPACT]
```

#### Pattern 3: Change Management
```
Create change request for:
What: [CHANGE_DESCRIPTION]
Why: [BUSINESS_JUSTIFICATION]
Risk: [RISK_LEVEL]
Rollback: [INCLUDE/EXCLUDE]
```
