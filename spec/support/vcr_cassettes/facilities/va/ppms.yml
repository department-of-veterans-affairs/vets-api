Training includes didactic work, peer group experience, and supervised practicum.  An NFBPT credentialed certified poetry therapist (CPT) or registered poetry therapist (PTR) integrates discussion of published literature and reflective or creative writing into the psychotherapeutic process to achieve goals of emotional well-being, symptom reduction, and improved interpersonal communication.  Certified poetry therapists and registered poetry therapists are licensed mental health professionals with advanced training in the theory and practice of poetry therapy. CPTs and PTRs are qualified to work independently with emotionally troubled populations in clinical, rehabilitative, community and educational institutions. They also work with emotionally healthy individuals adjusting to developmental issues, life crises, or disabilities. The PTR completes an advanced level of training and fieldwork, commensurate with the highest levels of clinical practice. The terms poetry therapy, applied poetry facilitation, journal therapy, bibliotherapy, biblio/poetry therapy, and poetry/journal therapy reflect the interactive use of literature and/or writing to promote personal growth and emotional healing. In addition to poetry, poetry therapy applies all forms or written and spoken language including story, myth, folk and fairy tale and other genres of poetic expression as well as journal, memoir, and narrative. The poetry therapy process integrates discussion of published literature and reflective or creative writing for expression and communication of thoughts and feelings to facilitate participants emotional well-being. The field of poetry therapy encompasses all of these modalities, though only a duly trained and licensed clinical practitioner can be credentialed as CPT or PTR."}]}'
