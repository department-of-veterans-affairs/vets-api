# What is vets-api CheckIn?

The CheckIn module is a pass through API to the chip-api, which is a specialized service that orchestrates the Check-In process by coordinating with the VEText, VistA, and LoROTA services.

## The CheckIn module exposes two endpoints:Â 

- The `GET /v0/patient_check_ins/:id` route accepts a LoROTA `id` and returns the data which is relevant to a patient's check-in at a given location and time.

- The `POST /v0/patient_check_ins` route accepts POST data from an upstream client and submits it to the relevant chip-api endpoint. A success or fail message will be sent back to the client depending on the chip-api response.

## The CheckIn modules chip-api Integration:
