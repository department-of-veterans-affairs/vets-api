## Background

The Benefits Claims API Version 2 lets internal consumers: 

-   Retrieve existing claim information, including status, by claim ID
-   Automatically establish an Intent To File (21-0966) in VBMS

Additional functionality will be added over time.

You should use the [Benefits Claims API Version 1](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current) if: 

-   You are not an internal consumer, and/or
-   You want automatic establishment of disability compensation claims in Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) or power of attorney (POA)
    
## Technical Overview

This API accepts a payload of requests and responses with the payload identifying the claim and Veteran. Responses provide the submission’s processing status. Responses also provide a unique ID which can be used with the appropriate GET endpoint to return detailed, end-to-end claims status tracking. 

End-to-end claims tracking provides the status of claims as they move through the submission process, but does not return whether the claim was approved or denied. 

### Claim statuses

-   Pending - the claim is successfully submitted to Lighthouse
-   Errored -  the submission encountered upstream errors
-   Canceled -  the claim was identified as a duplicate or another issue caused the claim to be canceled. For duplicate claims,  the tracking of the claim's progress happens under a different Claim ID . 

Other statuses this API returns align with the [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) [claim status descriptions](https://www.va.gov/resources/what-your-claim-status-means/), which are:

-   Claim received
-   Initial review
-   Evidence gathering, review, and decision
-   Preparation for notification
-   Complete

### Finding a Veteran's unique VA ID

This API uses a unique Veteran identifier to identify the subject of each API request. This Veteran identifier can be retrieved by passing the Veteran’s first name, last name, DOB, and SSN to the ‘/veteran-id’ endpoint. This identifier should then be used as the Veteran ID parameter in request URLs.

Note: though Veteran identifiers are typically static, they may change over time. If a specific Veteran ID suddenly responds with a ‘404 not found’ error, the identifier may have changed. It’s a good idea to periodically check the identifier for each Veteran.

### Authentication and authorization

To make an API request, use our [client credentials grant](https://developer.va.gov/explore/authorization/docs/client-credentials?api=claims) to receive an [OAuth token](https://oauth.net/2/). 

### Test data for sandbox environment use

We use mock [test data in the sandbox environment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts.md). Sandbox test data and test users for the Benefits Claims API are valid for all versions of the API.
