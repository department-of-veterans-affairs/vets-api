# Vets.gov API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api)

This project provides commons APIs for applications that live on vets.gov. This repo is in its infancy - more information coming soon!

## Developer Setup

1. Install Ruby 2.3. (It is suggested to use a Ruby version manager such as [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) and then to [install Ruby 2.3](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions)).
1. Install Bundler to manage dependencies: `gem install bundler`
1. Setup the database: `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
1. Start the application: `bundle exec rails s`

## Commands
- `bundle exec rake lint` - Run the full suite of linters on the codebase.
- `bundle exec guard` - Runs the guard test server that reruns your tests after files are saved. Useful for TDD!
- `bundle exec rake security` - Run the suite of security scanners on the codebase.
- `bundle exec rake ci` - Run all build steps performed in Travis CI.

## Deployment Instructions

(TODO: Add deployment instructions, Ansible templates when ready.)
