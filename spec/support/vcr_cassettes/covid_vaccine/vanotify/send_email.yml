        for signing up to stay informed about COVID-19 vaccines at VA. When we have
        new information to share about our COVID-19 plans and your vaccine options,
        we''ll send you updates by email or text.\n\nYour local VA health facility
        may also use the information you provided to determine when to contact you
        about getting a vaccine once your risk group becomes eligible. If you told
        us you plan to get a vaccine, your facility may contact you sooner. You can
        always change your mind about getting a vaccine. And you can submit a new
        form to update your information at any time.\n\n__Note for caregivers:__ If
        you\u2019re a designated primary or secondary caregiver in the Program of
        Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, your facility will tell you
        when you can get a vaccine at the same time as the Veteran you care for.\n\n__You
        should know:__\n- To get a vaccine at VA, Veterans must be already receiving
        health care at VA. If you don\u2019t\u00a0receive care at VA now, [find out
        if you''re eligible for VA health care and how to apply](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply).\n-
        To get a vaccine at VA, family caregivers must be enrolled in our [Program
        of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers](https://www.va.gov/family-member-benefits/comprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers/).
        Caregivers are eligible for a vaccine when the Veteran they care for becomes
        eligible for one.\n- You can change your mind about getting a vaccine at any
        time. If you want to learn more before you decide:\n[Get answers to common

        How will VA contact me when I can get a COVID-19 vaccine?\nYour local VA health
        facility may contact you by phone, email, or text message. If you\u2019re
        eligible and want to get a vaccine, we encourage you to respond.\n\nBut before
        you provide any personal information or click on any links, be sure the call,
        email, or text is really from VA.\n- Text messages will always come from __53079__.\n-
        Emails will always come from a __va.gov__ email address.\n- If someone calls
        you from VA and you don\u2019t recognize the phone number, ask for a number
        to call them back. Then call your local VA health facility to verify. \n\nYour
        facility may invite you to get a vaccine in different ways:\n- They may invite
        you to a large vaccination event, like a drive-thru clinic.\n- They may offer
        you a specific date and time to get a vaccine.\n- They may ask you to schedule
        an appointment.\n\n__Please know:__ By sharing your plans for getting a vaccine,
        you help us better plan our efforts. But we\u2019ll still contact every eligible
        Veteran in each risk group to ask if they want to get a vaccine. You don\u2019t
        need to call or come to a VA facility to request or reserve a vaccine. \n\n---\nYou\u2019re
        getting this email because you signed up on VA.gov to get updates about our
