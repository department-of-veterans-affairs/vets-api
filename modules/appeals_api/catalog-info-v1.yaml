  description: The Decision Reviews API is a collection of submission paths and services in support of the decision review process pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act of 2017. The API enables applications that allow Veterans to digitally submit Higher-Level Reviews (VA form 21-0996), Supplemental Claims (VA form 21-0995), and Notices of Disagreement (VA form 21-10182) into the mail handling system. End-users of the API can use it to retrieve a list of issues eligible for appeal for each decision review type, find appeals from the legacy appeals process that are eligible to be moved into the AMA process, and submit forms and accompanying evidence to initiate an appeal.
