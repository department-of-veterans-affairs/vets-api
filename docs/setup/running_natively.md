## Running the app Natively

### EKS

Prior to EKS, ClamAV (the virus scanner) was deployed in the same process as Vets API. With EKS, ClamAV has been extracted out into itâ€™s own service. Locally you can see the docker-compose.yml config for clamav.

**TODO**: Running clamav natively, as we did in Vets API master still needs to be configured. For the time being, **please run via docker**:

Please set the [clamav intitalizer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/k8s/config/initializers/clamav.rb) initializers/clamav.rb file to the following:

``` 
# ## If running hybrid
if Rails.env.development?
   ENV["CLAMD_TCP_HOST"] = "0.0.0.0"
   ENV["CLAMD_TCP_PORT"] = "33100"
 end
```

### Options
#### Option 1: Run ONLY clamav via Docker

You can either run:
`docker-compose -f docker-compose-clamav.yml up` - this will run ONLY clamav via docker

After that, follow the native instructions and run `foreman start -m all=1`

#### Option 2: [See hybrid setup](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/k8s/docs/setup/hybrid.md)

### Running tests

- `bundle exec rake spec` - Run the entire test suite  ( for `rspec spec`). Test coverage statistics are in `coverage/index.html`.
- `make guard` - Run the guard test server that reruns your tests after files are saved. Useful for TDD!

### Running tests in parallel
- NOTE: Running specs in parallel requires that your development database exists, and is up to date. If necessary, you may need to run `bundle exec rake db:create` and `bundle exec rake db:migrate` before the following steps.
- `RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake parallel:setup` - This prepares all of the test databases. It will create a test database for each processor on your computer.
- `RAILS_ENV=test NOCOVERAGE=true bundle exec rake parallel:spec` - This runs the entire test suite. Optionally, a folder path can be given as a parameter. Each file is assigned a processor, so it probably doesn't make sense to pass an individual file to run it in parallel. It is currently suggested to forgo the coverage testing by adding `NOCOVERAGE=true` flag (currently the coverage check will fail, even if the test suite passes). If you would like to check coverage for the test run, remove that flag.

### Running linters

- `rake lint` - Run the full suite of linters on the codebase and autocorrect.
- `rake security` - Run the suite of security scanners on the codebase.
- `rake ci` - Run all build steps performed in CI.

### Running a rails interactive console

- `rails console` -  runs an IRB like REPL in which all of the API's classes and environmental variables have been loaded.
