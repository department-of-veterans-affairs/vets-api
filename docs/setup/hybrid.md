# Developer Setup

In hybrid mode, you will run vets-api natively, but run Postgres and Redis in Docker. By doing so you avoid any challenges of installing these two software packages and keeping them upgraded to the appropriate version.



## Base Setup

1. Install Docker as referenced in the [Docker setup instructions](docker.md).

1. Follow the [Native setup instructions](native.md), but skip any steps related to installing Postgres, Postgis, or Redis. You *will* need to install the other dependencies such as pdftk and clamav.

1. Configure vets-api to point to the Docker-ized dependencies. Add the following to `config/settings.local.yml`:

```
database_url: postgis://postgres:password@localhost:54320/vets_api_development?pool=4
test_database_url: postgis://postgres:password@localhost:54320/vets_api_test?pool=4

redis:
  host: localhost
  port: 63790
  app_data:
    url: redis://localhost:63790
  sidekiq:
    url: redis://localhost:63790
```

*Note: If you have local instances of Postgres or Redis that were only for use by vets-api, you can stop them to save system resources.*

## Running

1. To start Postgres and Redis: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-deps.yml up`

1. Start vets-api as per the [native running instructions](running_natively.md).
