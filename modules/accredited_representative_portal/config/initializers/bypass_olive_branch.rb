module AccreditedRepresentativePortal
  ##
  # `olive_branch` transforms (a) request and (b) response payloads.
  #
  # (a) It deeply transforms request and query param keys.
  # At times it is convenient for params to act as snake-cased setters at a Ruby
  # interface, but not always. Form resources are a possible example where not.
  #
  # For now, let's wait to encounter the cases where we really want this
  # convenience. If we do encounter some, we may discover that we want a more
  # explicit and collocated way to opt in.
  #
  # (b) It reloads the response from JSON, deeply transforms keys, and dumps
  # back to JSON.
  # This is superfluous because our serialization layer `jsonapi-serializer`
  # already has a configuration option for key casing. This realizes our desired
  # casing the one and only time it is visiting an object during serialization.
