# This cop forces you to put a return at the beginning of a block of code rather than having an if statement
# whose body carries to the end of the function. For example:
#
# def foo
#   ...
#   if test
#     ...
#   end
# end
#
# would be considered bad, and the cop would force you to put a `return if !test` before that block and
# then remove the if. The problem is that this hides intent, since the if test does have a purpose in
# readability, and it could also be easier for future changes to miss the return statement and add code
# after it expecting it to be executed.
Style/GuardClause:
  Enabled: false

# This is pretty much the same thing as the one above. Inside a loop, it forces you to use next to skip
# iteration rather than using an if block that runs to the end of the loop, and it suffers from the same
# problems as above.

# This forces you to replace things like: `[1, 2, 3].length == 0` with `[1,2,3].empty?`. The problem is that
# not all things that implement length also implement empty? so you will get errors that cannot be resolved,
# and the cop will encourage you to do things that are incorrect.
