The Benefits Claims API allows authenticated, authorized individuals (Veterans or their representatives) to digitally submit and automatically establish certain claims, along with supporting documentation. It also allows those users to see information about current claims, including their status.

Internal VA consumers such as mail processing vendors can use an organizational token to establish disability compensation claims automatically.

Whereas the Benefits Intake API sends PDFs to be uploaded to the Centralized Mail Portal, the Benefits Claims API accepts more data, using it to automatically establish those claims so they're immediately accessible to Veteran Service Representatives in VBMS (Veterans Benefits Management System). This bypasses several days of processing time, helping eligible Veterans receive their benefits more quickly.

Currently, the API supports automatic establishment of: 

 - Application for Disability Compensation (21-526EZ)
 - Intent to File (21-0966)
 - Appointment of Representative (21-22 and 21-22a) **(in test environments only)**

## Technical Summary
The Benefits Claims API accepts a payload consisting of [JSON API compliant](https://jsonapi.org/) requests and responses on a per-form basis. The payload describes the form and identifies the person for whom it is being submitted.

Some forms allow or require supporting documents to be uploaded, encoded as binary multipart/form data. 

The API provides a unique identifier with the response payload of most forms. This identifier can then be used to request the processing status of the uploaded document package.

API consumers are encouraged to validate the JSON Schema before submission, according to their description in the form models provided.

## Design

### Authentication
In order to make an API request, individuals must first go through our OAuth SAML Proxy and scoping process. They will then receive the required API key. 

If the OAuth token belongs to the **Veteran**, only the token is required to access all data related to that Veteran. 

If the token belongs to a **Veteran Representative**, the individual must be accredited by the organization who holds Power of Attorney (POA) for the Veteran, or be appointed directly. The API compares the authenticated individual's accreditations or POA codes with the Office of General Council's database, in order to validate that the Representative's POA codes match the code for the Veteran's current POA. When a Representative is the authenticated user type, the API also requires the Veteran's SSN, first name, last name, and date of birth. 

**Internal** VA users (such as mail processing vendors) authenticate using an API key issued at the organizational level. Currently, this authentication model is only supported in V0. To learn more about this authentication path, select Version 0.0.1 from the drop-down menu above.

*   [Sample applications](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/tree/master/samples) showing this authentication model in use


#### OAuth Scopes for Benefits Claims API
*   `claim.read`
    *   This scope is required for any /claims GET endpoints
*   `claim.write`
    *   This scope is required for any form auto-establishment endpoints


### Attachment & File Size Limits
There is not a limit on the number of documents that can be submitted at once, but file sizes can impact the number of documents accepted.

The file size limit for each document is 100 MB. The entire package, which is all documents combined into one file, is limited to 5 GB.

Documents must be within the dimensions of 11" x 11".


### Original Claims and 21-526 PDF Generation
**Original Claim** refers to the first Benefits claim a Veteran has ever filed with VA, regardless of that claim's type or status. VA policy requires that original claims be filed with the Veteran's own signature or electronic authorization, while subsequent claims may be filed with the signature of their power of attorney.  

By default, the API generates PDFs of form 21-526 based on incoming data, and the OAuth token of either the Veteran or their representative is used to represent electronic authorization of submitted documents. However, when a previous claim does not exist for a given Veteran, and a 21-526 is filed by anyone other than the Veteran, the API requires that PDF generation be disabled, and that a signed copy of the 21-526 is attached in addition to the required fields in the payload.



### Mock Data in Test Environments 
Mock data is used for all forms in the Development environment, and for 21-526 submissions in the Staging environment.
