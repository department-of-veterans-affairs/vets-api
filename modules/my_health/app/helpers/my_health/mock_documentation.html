      Brand Name(s): Lipitor®, Caduet® (as a combination product containing

    <h2>WHY is this medicine prescribed?</h2>
    <p>
      Atorvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to
      reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that
      heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are
      at risk of developing heart disease. Atorvastatin is also used to decrease
      the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
      cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to
      increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good
      cholesterol') in the blood. Atorvastatin may also be used to decrease the
      amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children
      and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous
      hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot
      be removed from the body normally). Atorvastatin is in a class of
      medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by
      slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount
      of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block
      blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body.

    <h2>HOW should this medicine be used?</h2>
    <p>
      Atorvastatin comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once
      a day with or without food. Take atorvastatin at around the same time
      every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and
      ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.
      Take atorvastatin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or
      take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your doctor may start you on a low dose of atorvastatin and gradually
      increase your dose, not more than once every 2 to 4 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continue to take atorvastatin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking
      atorvastatin without talking to your doctor.

    <h2>What should I know about STORAGE and DISPOSAL of this medication?</h2>
    <p>
      It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children
      as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops,
      creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children
      can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always
      lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location –
      one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.
