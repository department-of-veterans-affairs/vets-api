      description: Given a date range returns a list of upcoming VA, Community Care, and Express Care appointments. If start and end date ranges are not passed in then it defaults to - 1 year and + 1 year from the beginning of today's UTC date. The endpoint is paginated and call with no pagination params defaults to page 1 with a page size of 10. Details on links for the other pages in the set are included in the "links" object. The current page is the "self" link. "prev" and "next" are the previous and next links (these will be null if you are on the first or last page respectively). Finally "first" and "last" are the links for the first and last page. Requesting a page out of bounds will return an empty list, however if will still include "links" details for the pages that are in bounds.

      summary: /v0/user/addresses/validate
      description: Validates a residential or mailing address for a user. Calling this endpoint is the first step in adding a new address for a user. If the address is valid you'll receive a 'addressMetaData' object back with the addresses confidence score. This object should then be included along with the new address in the request body. If the user wishes to continue with an 'invalid' address then the 'validationKey' should be passed along with the new address in the request body. This lets the underlying service know that an invalid address be passed through.
