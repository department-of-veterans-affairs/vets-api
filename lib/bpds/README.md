The BPDS forward proxy can be set up locally following the instructions documented here:
 https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/2f04df4b725cae761f7dda1eaa2ca476bab5af49/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/engineering/mhv-api-tunnel-setup.md

For local setup, replace the bpds.jwt_secret in settings.yml or development.yml with the official dev key in the parameter store. Here is the link to the secret in the parameter store:

We still currently have a gap in our knowledge regarding the function of the MAS system. We will eventually need a way to link the JSON submission to a VA claim ID, since the POI system relies on the claim ID to process submissions. We may eventually generate our own claim IDs for each submission and expose an API endpoint to return a list of unprocessed claim IDs or submissions, but that will be fleshed out when we have more information.
