  # Cache Aside pattern for caching an ActiveRecord::Base db record in redis.

  # Requires the model mixing it in to:
  #  - be an ActiveRecord::Base class
  #  - implement a #cache? method
  #
  # Expects the model mixing it in to:
  #   - set the config by calling redis and redis_ttl
  #   - call the do_cached_with with the desired unique key
  #   - require this class
  #
  # @see app/models/account.rb for sample usage
