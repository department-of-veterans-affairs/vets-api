Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) claims submission and status checking.

## Background

Use this API to submit a Veteran's benefits claim, and to request the status of a Veteran's benefits claim.

The Benefit Claim API passes data through to Electronic Veterans Self Service, EVSS.

EVSS uses VAAFI to authenticate requests.
